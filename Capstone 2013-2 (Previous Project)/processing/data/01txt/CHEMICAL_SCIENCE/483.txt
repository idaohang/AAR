The crystal structure of a second monoclinic polymorph of anilinium picrate shows a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded polymer with strong primary interspecies interactions involving the proximal phenolate and adjacent nitro group O-atom acceptors and separate anilinium H-atom donors in two cyclic R (6) associations. Other nitro-O-anilinium-H hydrogen bonds together with heteromolecular interactions are also present.
