The thermal decomposition of a suite of synthetic agardites of formula ACu6(AsO4)2(OH)6.3H2O where A is given by a rare earth element has been studied using thermogravimetric analysis techniques.  Dehydration of the agardites occurs at low temperatures and over an extended temperature range from ambient to around 60 degrees Celsius.  This loss of water is attributed to the loss of zeolitic water.  The mass loss of water indicates 3 moles of zeolitic water in the structure.  Dehydroxylation occurs in steps over a wide range of temperatures from 235 to 456 degrees Celsius.  The mass loss during dehydroxylation shows the number of moles of hydroxyl units is six.  There is a linear relationship between the first dehydroxylation temperature and the electronegativity of the REE.
