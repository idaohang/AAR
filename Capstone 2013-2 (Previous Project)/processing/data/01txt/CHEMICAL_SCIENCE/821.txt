Hot stage Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the changes in structure of salÃ©eite (Mg(UO2)2(PO4)2.10H2O) during dehydration. Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw Raman microscope coupled with a Linkham thermal stage. Temperatures for Raman spectroscopic analysis were selected by studying the high resolution thermogravimetric analysis of the mineral salÃ©eite. Five stages of dehydration are observed at 43, 73, 87, 231 and 376 degrees Celsius with the loss of 3, 3, 2, 1 and 1 mole of water respectively.  Three antisymmetric PO4 stretching vibrations are observed at 1007, 994 and 980 cm-1. No symmetric stretching vibration is observed until after significant dehydration has occurred at 75 degrees Celsius, when a low intensity band at 927 cm-1 is observed. Two bands at 843 and 827 cm-1 are attributed to the symmetric stretching modes of the two UO2 vibrational modes resulting from the two non-equivalent UO bonds.  The low intensity band at 894 cm-1 is assigned to the UO2 antisymmetric stretching mode. The complexity that is observed in the Î½3 antisymmetric stretching region of the PO4 units is also observed in the PO4 Î½2 bending region.  Four bands are observed at 471, 446, 405 and 376 cm-1.  Two bands observed at 283 and 234 cm-1 are assigned to the (UO2)2+ bending modes. After dehydration it is suggested that the structure loses its distortion, takes on a tetragonal structure and hence the Raman spectra become less complex upon thermal treatment.
