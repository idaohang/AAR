The mineral peisleyite has been studied using a combination of electron microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy. SEM photomicrographs reveal that the peisleyite morphology consists of an array of small needle like crystals of around 1 Î¼m in length with a thickness of less than 0.1 Î¼m. Raman spectroscopy in the hydroxyl stretching region shows an intense band at 3506 cm-1 assigned to the symmetric stretching mode of the OH units. Four bands are observed at 3564, 3404, 3250 and 3135 cm-1 in the infrared spectrum. These wavenumbers enable an estimation of the hydrogen bond distances 3.052(5), 2.801(0), 2.705(6) and 2.683(6) Ã…. Two intense Raman bands are observed at 1023 and 989 cm-1 and are assigned to the SO4 and PO4 symmetric stretching modes. Other bands are observed at 1356, 1252, 1235, 1152, 1128, 1098 and 1067 cm-1. The bands at 1067 is attributed to AlOH deformation vibrations. Bands in the low wavenumber region are assigned to the Î½4 and Î½2 out of plane bending modes of the SO4 and PO4 units. Raman spectroscopy is a useful tool in determining the vibrational spectroscopy of mixed hydrated multianion minerals such as peisleyite. Information on such a mineral would be difficult to obtain by other means.
