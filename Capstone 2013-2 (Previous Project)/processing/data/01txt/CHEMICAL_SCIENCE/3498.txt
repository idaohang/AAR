Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the molecular structure of a series of selected uranyl silicate minerals including weeksite K2[(UO2)2(Si5O13)].H2O, soddyite [(UO2)2SiO4.2H2O] and haiweeite Ca[(UO2)2(Si5O12(OH)2](H2O)3 with UO22+/SiO2 molar ratio 2:1 or 2:5 .Raman spectra clearly show well resolved bands in the 750 to 800 cm-1 region and in the 950 to 1000 cm-1 region assigned to the Î½1 modes of the (UO2)2+ units and to the (SiO4)4- tetrahedra.  For example soddyite is characterised by Raman bands at 828.0, 808.6, 801.8 cm-1 (UO2)2+ (ï¿®1), 909.6 and 898.0 cm-1 (UO2)2+ (ï¿®3), 268.2 cm-1 and 257.8 and 246.9 cm-1are assigned to the ï¿®2 (ï¿¤) (UO2)2+. Coincidences of the ï¿®1 (UO2)2+ and the ï¿®1 (SiO4)4- is expected. Bands at 1082.2, 1071.2, 1036.3, 995.1, 966.3  cm-1 are attributed to the ï¿®3 (SiO4)4-.Sets of Raman bands in the 200 to 300 cm-1 region are assigned to Î½2 Î´ (UO2)2+ and UO ligand vibrations.  Multiple bands indicate the non-equivalence of the UO bonds and the lifting of the degeneracy of Î½2 Î´ (UO2)2+ vibrations. The (SiO4)4- tetrahedral are characterized by bands in the 470 to 550 cm-1 and in the 390 to 420 cm-1 region. These bands are attributed to the Î½4 and Î½2 (SiO4)4- bending modes.  The minerals show characteristic OH stretching bands in the 2900 to 3500 cm-1 and 3600 to 3700 cm-1.
