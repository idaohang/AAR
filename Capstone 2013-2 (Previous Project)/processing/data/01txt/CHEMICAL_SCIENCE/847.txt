X-ray diffraction has been used to study the changes in the surface properties of a montmorillonitic clay through the changes in the basal spacings of montmorillonite (SWy-2) and surfactant-intercalated organo-clays.  Variation in the d-spacing was found to be a step-function of the surfactant concentration.   High resolution thermogravimetric analysis (HRTG) was used to study the thermal decomposition surfactant modified SWy-2-MMTs modified with the surfactant octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. High resolution thermogravimetry shows the decomposition takes place in 4 steps.  A mass loss step is observed at room temperature and is attributed to dehydration of adsorption water. A second mass loss step is observed over the 87.9 to 135.5 degrees Celsius temperature range and is also attributed to dehydration of  water hydrating metal cations such as Na+ . The third mass loss occurs from 178.9 to 384.5 degrees Celsius and is assigned to a loss of surfactant. The fourth mass loss step is ascribed to the loss of OH units through dehydroxylation over the 556.01 to 636.35 degrees Celsius temperature range.
