Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) has been used to analyse a suite of synthesised jarosites of formula Mn(Fe 3+)6(SO4)4(OH)12 where M is K, Na, Ag, Pb, NH4+ and H3O+.  Whilst the spectra of the jarosites show a common pattern differences in the spectra are observed which enable the minerals to be distinguished.   The NIR bands in the 6300 to 7000 cm-1 region are attributed to the first fundamental overtone of the infrared and Raman hydroxyl stretching vibrations. The NIR spectrum of the ammonium jarosite shows additional bands at 6460 and 6143 cm-1 attributed to the first fundamental overtones of NH stretching vibrations. A set of bands are observed in the 4700 to 5500 cm-1 region which are assigned to combination bands of the hydroxyl stretching and deformation vibrations. The ammonium jarosite shows additional bands at 4730 and 4621 cm-1attributed to the combination of NH stretching and bending vibrations.  NIR spectroscopy has the ability to distinguish between the jarosite minerals even when the formula of the minerals is closely related.  The NIR spectroscopic technique has great potential as a mineral exploratory tool on planets and in particular Mars.
