Novel porphyrinoids with interrupted conjugation (di-iminoporphodimethenes) result from the Pd-catalyzed coupling of meso-bromo porphyrins and their metal complexes with carbazates and hydrazones, followed by aerial oxidation. X-Ray crystallography revealed a saddle shape for molecules of the nickel(II) complex of a di-iminoporphodimethene.
