Raman spectroscopy has been used to investigate raw cotton acetylation using acetic anhydride/4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyst blend without solvent. The Raman data further confirm successful acetylation as shown by FTIR that was demonstrated previously to be highly sensitive for determining the level of acetylation. However, the Raman peaks are much weaker than the FTIR bands. Nevertheless, the variations of the extent of acetylation estimated from both Raman and FTIR spectra with weight percent gain due to acetylation (WPG) were observed to follow the same pattern. The degrees of acetylation calculated from Raman data were also found to increase linearly with that calculated from the more sensitive FTIR technique. Raman technique is thus suitable for further development as an analytical tool for determining the acetylation level of natural cellulose fibres. Raman data have also shown that the acetylation reaction reduces the crystallinity of cotton.
