A detailed study of poly(alkylthiophene) self-assembly and organization on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is presented. Monolayers of regioregular poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (rrP3HT) adsorbed on SWNTs have been imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy. Our results show that the rrP3HT interchain distance is greater for rrP3HT monolayers adsorbed onto the curved surfaces of SWNTs than on the flat surfaces of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite samples. Comparisons between the native polymer deposited on graphite and the composite structure confirmed that the presence of carbon nanotubes in rrP3HT produces a material with a high degree of order at the molecular level.
