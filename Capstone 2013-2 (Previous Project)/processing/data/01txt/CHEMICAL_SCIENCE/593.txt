The crystal structure of bis(2-pyrimidinyl) disulÂ®de dihydrate,  C8H6N4S22H2O, has been redetermined using CCD diffractometer  data. This has allowed for a more precise location of  the water H atoms and shows the water molecules forming  unusual spiral hydrogen-bonded aqua columns, as well as  giving inter-column crosslinks through the pyrimidine N-atom  acceptors of the disulÂ®de molecules. The structural chemistry  of aromatic disulÂ®des has also been reviewed.
