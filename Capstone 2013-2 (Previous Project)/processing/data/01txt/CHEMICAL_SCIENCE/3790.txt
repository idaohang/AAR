A series of novel organoclays with antibacterial activity were synthesized using Ca-montmorillonite and Chlorhexidini Acetas (CA) by ion-exchange. The resultant organoclays were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution thermogravimetric analysis (HRTG) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Their antibacterial activity was assayed by so-called halo method. In the organoclay prepared at low CA concentration, CA ions within the clay interlayer adopt a lateral monolayer while a â€˜kinkâ€™ state or a special state with partial overlapping of the intercalated CA in the organoclays prepared at 1.0 â€“ 4.0 CEC. HRTG analysis demonstrates that CA located outside the clay interlayer exists in all synthesised organoclays, resulting from the complex molecular configuration of CA. The dramatic decrease of the surface adsorbed water and interlayer water is caused by the surface property transformation and the replacement of hydrated cations by cationic surfactant. These observations are supported by the results of FTIR. Antibacterial activity test against E. coli demonstrates that the antibacterial activity of the resultant organoclays strongly depends on the content of CA. Meanwhile, the resultant organoclay shows a long-term antibacterial activity that can last for at least one year. These novel organoclays are of potential use in synthesis of organoclay-based materials with antibacterial activity.
