This paper describes the catalytic characteristics of synthetic saponites with well-known chemical composition, thermal stability and acidity in three catalytic reactions: 1) catalytic cracking of n-dodecane, 2) hydro-isomerization of n-heptane and 3) Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene. Saponites with Mg in the octahedral position was by far the best catalyst for the catalytic cracking of n-dodecane, which can be explained by the higher surface area of these saponites compared to saponites with other compositions. All saponites performed better in the hydro-isomerization reaction of n-heptane and Friedel-Crafts alkylation compared to commercially available catalysts such as HZSM-5 and ASA. The shape selectivity in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene towards p- and o-DIOPB was remarkably high for the synthetic saponites
