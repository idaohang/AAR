A combination of DSC and high resolution DTG coupled to a gas evolution mass spectrometer has been used to study the thermal properties of a series of Cu/Zn hydrotalcites of formulae CuxZn6-xAl2(OH)16(CO3).4H2O where x varied from 6 to 0. The effect of increased Zn composition results in the increase of the endotherms and weight loss steps to higher temperatures.  Evolved gas mass spectrometry shows that water is lost in a number of steps.  The interlayer carbonate anion is lost simultaneously with hydroxyl units. The endotherms and differential weight loss steps were both cation and mole ratio dependent.
