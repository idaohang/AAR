Curing and gelation of N,N,Nâ€™,Nâ€™-tetraglycidyl-4,4â€™-diaminodiphenylmethane (TGDDM-Araldite MY721), in the presence of an anhydride hardener mixture was studied by calorimetric and dynamic rheological measurements. Cure kinetics of the homogeneous and low temperature curable epoxy-system were evaluated from 40oC to 140oC and apparent activation energies of the curing reaction were calculated from different thermokinetic models. By comparison of different calorimetric and rheological methods, it was found that the results from the isothermal calorimetric measurements are in a good agreement with the results obtained from isothermal rheological experiments, while the kinetic parameter calculations based on dynamic calorimetric measurements are not reliable results. These differences mainly arise from the fact that dynamic measurements have many underlying assumptions and do not consider the equilibrium condition.
