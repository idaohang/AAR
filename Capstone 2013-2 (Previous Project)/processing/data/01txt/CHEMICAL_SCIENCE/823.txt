The thermal decomposition of natural iowaite of formula  Mg6Fe2(Cl,(CO3)0.5)(OH)16.4H2O was studied by using a combination of  thermogravimetry and evolved gas mass spectrometry. Thermal decomposition  occurs over a number of mass loss steps at 60 degrees Celsius attributed to dehydration, 266 degrees Celsius and 308 degrees Celsius  assigned to dehydroxylation of ferric ions, at 551 degrees Celsius attributed to decarbonation and dehydroxylation, and 644, 703 and 761 degrees Celsius attributed to further dehydroxylation. The mass spectrum of carbon dioxide exhibits a maximum at 523 degrees Celsius. The use of TG coupled to MS shows the complexity of the thermal decomposition of iowaite.
