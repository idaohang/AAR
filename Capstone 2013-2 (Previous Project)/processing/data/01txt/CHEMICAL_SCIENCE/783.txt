NIR spectroscopy has been applied to the study water in the interlayer of the autunite minerals. The spectra of autunites and metaautunites in the first HOH fundamental overtone are different and the spectra of autunites of different origins in the 6000 to 7500 cm-1 region are considerably different.  A number of conclusions are made based upon the NIR spectra: (a) The spectra of different autunites are different in the NIR spectral region (b) the spectra of metaautunites show similarity (c) the spectra of metaautunites are different from that of autunites.  NIR spectroscopy provides a method of determination of the structure of water in the interlayer of natural autunites.   The implication from the variation in the NIR spectra is that the structural arrangement of water for different autunites is different and is sample dependent. NIR spectroscopy has a wide potential for the study of the autunite minerals.
