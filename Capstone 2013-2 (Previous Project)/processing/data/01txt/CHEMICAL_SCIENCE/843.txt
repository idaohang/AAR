Struvite (NH4MgPO4.6H2O) is a mineral often found in urinary tracts and kidneys.  Thermal decomposition using slow low heating shows that the 'kidney' stone can be decomposed at temperatures below 40 degrees Celsius.  At this temperature both ammonia and water are evolved.  If more rapid heating is employed the decomposition occurs at around 80 degrees Celsius. The implication of this work rests with the use of low slow heat for the decomposition of the kidney stones.
