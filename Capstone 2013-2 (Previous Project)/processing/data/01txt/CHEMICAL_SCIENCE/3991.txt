We have explored the possibilities offered by the Environmental SEM to study minerals under a variety of conditions. Low voltage SEM can be used to study minerals without coating with gold or carbon, thereby allowing the researcher to use other analytical techniques on the same sample. Changes in pressure and temperature can be used to study mineral reactions such as wetting and drying but also the thermal behaviour such dehydration, dehydroxation or decarbonation. The general principles shown are not limited to the study of minerals but can be applied to a range of materials.
