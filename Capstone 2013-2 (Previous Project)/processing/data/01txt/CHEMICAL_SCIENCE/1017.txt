The Raman and infrared spectroscopy of three vanadinite [Pb5(VO4)Cl] specimens from three localities has been studied. Single crystal Raman spectra were obtained and the spectra were found to be both orientation and temperature dependent. Measurement of the Raman spectra at liquid nitrogen temperature enabled better band separation and increased intensities of weak bands through band narrowing enabling, the assignment of the bands in vanadinites to be made.  Two types of isomorphous substitution are identified (a) substitution in the bulk of the crystal where electron beam microanalysis identifies the presence of calcium and copper. (b) surface substitution where infrared spectroscopy shows the isomorphous substitution of vanadate by phosphate and of chloride by hydroxyl groups.
