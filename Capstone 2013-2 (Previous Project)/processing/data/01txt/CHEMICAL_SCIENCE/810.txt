Raman spectroscopy has been used to characterise several lead and mixed cationic-lead minerals including mendipite, perite, laurionite, diabolÃ©ite, bolÃ©ite, pseudobolÃ©ite, chloroxiphite, and cumengÃ©ite.   Raman spectroscopy enables their vibrational spectra to be compared.    The low wavenumber region is characterised by the bands assigned to cation-chloride stretching and bending modes.  Phosgenite is a mixed chloride-carbonate mineral and a comparison is made with the molecular structure of the aforementioned minerals.  Each mineral shows different hydroxyl-stretching vibrational patterns, but some similarity exists in the Raman spectra of the hydroxyl deformation modes.  Raman spectroscopy lends itself to the study of these types of minerals in complex mineral systems involving secondary mineral formation.
