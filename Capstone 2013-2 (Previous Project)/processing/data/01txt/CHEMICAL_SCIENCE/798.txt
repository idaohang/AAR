A variety of metal tungstates have been synthesised in a microwave assisted oven at  100 and 150Â°C and corresponding autogenous water vapour pressure within a time  frame of 30 minutes to 2 hours. The crystals formed are of submicrometer size and  show equidimensional and needle-like crystals. Increasing the synthesis time and  temperature results in the disappearance of the needles and the growth of the  equidimensional crystals. The Raman spectra are consistent with those reported for  the natural equivalents of these tungstates. The lead tungstate Î½1(Ag) mode is observed  at 904 cm-1, while the Î½2(Ag) vibration is observed as a strong band at at 326 cm-1  accompanied by a weak Î½2(Bg) . at 356 cm-1. The Î½3(Bg) vibration is located around  741 cm-1, whereas the Î½3(Eg) is found at 751 cm-1. Finally, the Î½4(Bg) vibration is  completely overlapping with the Î½2(Ag) vibration. The band around 271 cm-1 may be  the equivalent of the infrared active Î½4(Au) activated due to strain in the crystal. The  two bands at 190 and 177 cm-1 are ascribed to the Î½(Pb-O) and as a translational mode  of the WO4 group in stolzite.
