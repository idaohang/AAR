Mineral samples of cinnabar were obtained from the ancient mining sites of Tarna and Almaden in Spain and from Hunan province in China.  A comparison is made using a combination of scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy with the cinnabar coated upon the wall of Herodâ€™s palace.  Scanning electron microscopy shows that the cinnabar samples from Spain were impure, whereas the sample from the wall of Herodâ€™s palace was highly pure.  No conclusion can be drawn as to the likely origin of the Herodâ€™s palace cinnabar and the mineral is just as likely to have originated in Tuscany, or China as Spain.
