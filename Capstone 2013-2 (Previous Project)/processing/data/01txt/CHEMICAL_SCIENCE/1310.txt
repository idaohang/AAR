Goethite nanotubes have been synthesised using polyethylene oxide surfactant as a directing agent. The surfactant enables the goethite to crystallise along a specific pathway and does not affect the crystal structure of the mineral but rather the agglomeration of the mineral. The crystals reach an optimum size at which the surfactant can bond.
