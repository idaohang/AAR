The structures of two pseudopolymorphic hydrates of brucine, C23H26N2O4Â·4H2O, (I), and C23H26N2O4Â·5.25H2O, (II), have been determined at 130  K. In both (I) and (II) (which has two independent brucine molecules together with 10.5 water molecules of solvation in the asymmetric unit), the brucine molecules form head-to-tail sheet substructures, which associate with the water molecules in the interstitial cavities through hydrogen-bonding associations and, together with water-water associations, give three-dimensional framework structures.
