The orientation of HDTMA+ in the interlayer of organic pillared montmorillonites prepared at different concentrations of HDTMA+ have been studied using X-ray  powder diffraction (XRD) and theoretical calculation. A series of arrangement models of HDTMA+ in the interlayer of montmorillonite have been proposed as lateral-monolayer (LM), lateral-bilayer (LB), pseudotrilayer (PT), paraffin-type-monolayer (PM), paraffin-type-bilayer (PB). With the increase of the concentration of HDTMA+, the arrangement model of HDTMA+ in the interlayer of montmorillonites changes as lateral-monolayerâ†’lateral-bilayerâ†’paraffin-type monolayerâ†’pseudotrilayerâ†’paraffin-type-bilayer and the packing density of HDTMA+ in the interlayer increases gradually. In the intermediate stages, different models may coexist.
