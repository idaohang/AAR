Raman spectra of walpurgite, (UO2)Bi4O4(AsO4)2. 2 H2O, recorded at 298 K and 77 K are presented and compared with infrared spectra of walpurgite and phosphowalpurgite. Bands connected with (UO2)2+, (AsO4)3- and H2O stretch and bend, and Bi-O stretch are tentatively assigned. Hydrogen bond lengths are calculated from the wavenumbers of the H2O stretching vibrations and compared with those from crystal structure analysis of walpurgite.
