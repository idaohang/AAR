Combined mid-IR and Raman spectroscopies indicate that intercalation of hexacyanoferrate (II) and (III) in the interlayer space of a Zn,Al hydrotalcite dried at 60 degrees Celsius leads to layered solids where the intercalated species correspond to both hexacyanoferrate(II) and (III). This is an indication that depending on the oxidation state of the initial hexacyanoferrate, partial oxidation and reduction takes place upon intercalation. The symmetry of the intercalated hexacyanoferrate decreases from Oh existing in the free anions to D3d. The observation of a broad band around 2080 cm-1 is indicative of the removal of cyanide from the intercalation complex to the outside surface of the crystals. Its position in the intercalation complex is probably filled by an hydroxyl group.    NOTE: Figures are in a separate file
