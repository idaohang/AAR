Blends of starch and a biodegradable polyester, produced by an extrusion process which included a cross-linker/compatibilizer (maleic anhydride) and an initiator (dicumyl peroxide), were studied by infrared (IR) microspectroscopy using an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) objective. Extruded material, which had a diameter of about 3 mm, was sectioned and embedded in epoxy resin prior to IR analysis. Spectra were collected in a grid pattern across the sectioned face of the sample. Measurement of various band parameters from the spectra allowed IR maps to be constructed containing semi-quantitative information about the distribution of blend components. These maps showed the quality of the blend on a microscopic scale and showed how it varied with different concentrations of compatibilizer and initiator.
