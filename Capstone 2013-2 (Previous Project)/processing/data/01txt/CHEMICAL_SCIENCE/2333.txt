The phosphate minerals hannayite, newberyite and struvite have been studied by Raman spectroscopy using a thermal stage. Hannayite and newberyite are characterised by an intense band at around 980 cm-1 assigned to the Î½1 symmetric stretching vibration of the HPO4 units. In contrast the symmetric stretching mode is observed at 942 cm-1 for struvite.  The Raman spectra are characterised by multiple Î½3 antisymmetric stretching bands and Î½2 and Î½4 bending modes indicating strong distortion of the HPO4 and PO4 units.  Hannayite and newberyite are defined by bands at 3382 and 3350 cm-1 attributed to HOPO3 vibrations and hannayite and struvite by bands at 2990, 2973 and 2874 assigned to NH4+ bands.  Raman spectroscopy has proven most useful for the analysis of these â€˜caveâ€™ minerals where complex paragenetic relationships exist between the minerals.
