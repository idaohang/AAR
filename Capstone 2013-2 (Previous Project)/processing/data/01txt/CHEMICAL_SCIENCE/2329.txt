Raman microscopy has been used to characterize the interlayer anions in synthesized hydrotalcites of formula Mg6Al2(OH)16(XO4).4H2O where X is S or Mo or Cr. The Raman spectroscopy shows that both the chromate and molybdate anions are not polymerised in the hydrotalcite interlayer. This lack of polymerisation is attributed to the effect of pH during synthesis. A model of bonding is proposed for the interlayer anions based upon the observation of two symmetric stretching modes and symmetry lowering of the chromate, molybdate and sulphate anions.  Two types of anions are present hydrated and hydroxyl surface bonded.
