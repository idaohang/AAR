Raman mapping by point illumination of polymer surfaces is discussed with examples taken from the plasma treatment of polypropylene (PP) and subsequent grafting of polystyrene (PS). Maps can be constructed for surface properties such as crystallinity, blend components and distribution of grafted PS. The Raman sampling volume was estimated for confocal operation using a 50x objective lens.
