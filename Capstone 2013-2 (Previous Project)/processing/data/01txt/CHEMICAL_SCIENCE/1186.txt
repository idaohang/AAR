This paper presents the results of the performance evaluation of the Ultraviolet Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (UVAPS, model 3312, TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN), the novel instrument for real-time monitoring of biological aerosols. The main objective of the study was to compare the UVAPS response in measuring aerosols containing the NADH, NADPH, or riboflavin particles. At the excitation and emission wavelengths at which the UVAPS operates, these compounds are the primary intrinsic fluorophores specific to biological particles. In addition, the study was focused on determining the detection limits of the UVAPS for these fluorophores. This information is important for the interpretation of UVAPS data while measuring bacterial aerosols. Fluorescence measurements were initially taken with a Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer for all three fluorophores. The samples were then aerosolized with the 6-jet Collison nebuliser. Riboflavin was found to be a stronger fluorophore than both NAD(P)H coenzymes. The fluorescence signals were considerably weaker for the NADPH samples compared to the NADH samples. The sensitivity of the UVAPS was found to be sufficiently high to detect the NADH and riboflavin at the concentrations characteristic to bacterial cells. The results of this study are discussed in a context of the results previously reported for the bacterial aerosols. It can be concluded, that the amount of fluorophores detectable in uniformly mixed particles is equal to or less than the fluorophores expected to be present in the individual bacterial particles.
