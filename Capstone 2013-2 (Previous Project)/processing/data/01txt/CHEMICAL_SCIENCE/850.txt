Copper was adsorbed onto Ca-exchanged montmorillonite (Cheto clay) under basic conditions. Differential Thermogravimetric Analysis (DTG) combined with evolved gas Mass Spectroscopy (MS) was employed as the principal technology to study the distribution and structure of adsorbed copper species on a montmorillonitic clay. The results showed that the original clay was easily rehydrated. After copper adsorption, a step-by-step replacement of hydrated calcium ions by copper-ammonia complex was observed through the gradual decrease of the first DTG dehydration peak intensity with increasing copper loading. Compared with the original clay, copper loaded samples showed new DTG peaks assigned to NH3 and N2O. The presence of N2O peak suggested that the loaded copper species were in agglomerated copper oxide form, which dispersed well over the edges and external surfaces of the clay layers.
