A series of related chromate bearing minerals including crocoite,  phoenicocroite, hemihedrite, iranite, macquartite, fornacite and vauquelinite have  been analysed by Raman microscopy. These minerals are closely related and often  have related paragenesis. Raman microscopy enables the selection of individual  crystals of these minerals for Raman spectroscopic analysis. This is of importance as  often the crystals are found adjacent to each other in the same matrix through  paragenetic relationships. The Raman spectrum of crocoite shows three bands in the  CrO4 stretching region at 856, 841 and 825 cm-1, phoenicocroite at 856, 848, 839 and  826 cm-1, hemihedrite at 847, 837 and 824 cm-1, iranite bands at 865, 846 and 818  cm-1, macquartite at 857, 840 and 814 cm-1. The Raman spectra of fornacite and  vauquelinite are complicated by the presence or AsO4 and PO4 units in the structure  and often the spectra are broad and vary with chemical composition. A comparison of  the spectra of these minerals is made with that of the hexavalent chromate mineral  edoylerite. Raman microscopy is a powerful and underutilized technique in terms of  mineralogy for the study of closely related minerals such as these chromate minerals.
