This paper describes an X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic study, including infrared, near-infrared and Raman spectroscopy of some selected zinnwaldites. In general, zinnwaldite forms a member of the trioctahedral true micas with characteristically Li in the octahedral positions and low iron contents. Although the infrared spectrum of zinnwaldite has been described before, near infrared and Raman spectroscopy have not been used so far to study this mineral. X-ray diffraction showed that all the samples reported in this study have the 1M structure. The Raman spectra are characterised by a strong band at 700-705 cm-1 plus a broad band associated with the SiO modes around 1100 cm-1. Less intense bands are observed around 560, 475, 403 and 305 cm-1. The corresponding IR spectra show strong overlapping SiO modes around 1020 cm-1 plus less intense bands around 790, 745, 530, 470-475 and 440 cm-1. Two overlapping OH-stretching modes can be observed around 3550-3650 cm-1, in agreement with a broad band in the IR around 3450 cm-1 and a complex band around 3630 cm-1. The near-IR spectra basically reflect combination and overtone bands associated with protons in the zinnwaldite structure. A very broad band observed around 5230 cm-1 is characteristic for adsorbed water while bands around 4530, 4435 and 4260 cm-1 can be ascribed to metal-hydroxyl groups.
