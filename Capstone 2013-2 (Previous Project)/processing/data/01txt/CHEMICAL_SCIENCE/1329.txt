Azurite {Cu2+3(CO3)2(OH)2} and malachite {Cu2+2(CO3)(OH)2}  are both monoclinic hydroxy carbonates of copper.  The Raman spectra of these two minerals have been collected at both 298 and 77 K together with the single crystal Raman spectra of azurite at 298 K.  The spectra of both azurite and malachite contain modes of three separate vibrational groups: OH, CO3 and Cu-O. Accordingly, for azurite the bands at 3453 and 3427 cm-1 have been assigned as the O-H stretching mode with the O-H bending modes found at 1035 and 952 cm-1. Malachite displays two hydroxyl stretching bands at 3474 and 3404 cm-1 at 298 K which shift to 3470 and 3400 cm-1 at 77 K while O-H out-of-plane bending modes are found at 1045 and 875 cm-1. For the carbonate group, bands are observed at 1090 cm-1 (Î½1), 837 and 817 cm-1 (Î½2), 1490 and 1415 cm-1 (Î½ 3), and 769 and 747 cm-1 (Î½ 4). The effect of collecting the spectra at 77 K results in considerable band narrowing.  The Raman spectra of the single crystals of azurite show the orientation dependence of the vibrational modes.  A mechanism for Î½2 splitting is proposed whereby vertical carbonate ions couple to form an in-phase and out of phase bending modes. Combination of these vibrational modes such as Î½ 1 + Î½ 3, Î½ 1 + Î½3, Î½1 + Î½4 and 2Î½2 are found at 2530, 2414, 1860, and 1670 cm-1, respectively. IR bands for the Cu-O stretching modes are observed at 495 and 400 cm-1, while Cu-O bending modes occur at 455 and 345 cm-1. Bands at 305 and 240 cm-1 are assigned to the O-Cu-OH bending modes. The Raman out-of-plane bending modes are found at 194 and 170 cm-1. For the carbonate group, infrared bands are observed at 1095 cm-1 (Î½1), 834 and 816 cm-1(Î½2), 1430 and 1419 cm-1 (Î½3) and  764 and 739 cm-1 (Î½ 4). Combination of the CO3 vibrational modes Î½1 + Î½4 is observed at 1860 cm-1. IR bands for Cu-O stretching modes are observed at 580, 570 and 505 cm-1.
