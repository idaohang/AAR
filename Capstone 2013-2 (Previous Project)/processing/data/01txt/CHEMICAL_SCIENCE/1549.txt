The thermal stability of kaolinite and the microstructure of its thermal products strongly depend on random defects (R2) rather than crystalline defects (HI). Kaolinite with lower random defect density is more stable than that with higher defect density during dehydroxylation and the derived metakaolinite can be directly transformed into orthorhombic mullite (3/2-mullite). However, for kaolinite with higher random defect density, there is a cubic phase occurring in the transformation from metakaolinite to primary mullite. Primary mullite will be transformed into orthorhombic mullite as temperature increases. AlV is universally present in the metakaolinite and the relative amounts of AlVI, AlV and AlIV vary with the random defect density of the parent kaolinite.
