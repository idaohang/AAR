The low-temperature (130 K) crystal structure of the second orthorhombic polymorph of metanilic acid (3-aminobenzenesulfonic acid), C6H7NO3S, shows the presence of two independent and conformationally similar molecules of the zwitterionic acid (3-ammoniobenzenesulfonate) in the asymmetric unit; these interact through hydrogen bonding to give a cyclic R22(14) association. Peripheral hydrogen bonding gives a three-dimensional framework polymer, such as was found in the earlier polymorph [Hall &amp; Maslen (1965), Acta Cryst. 18, 301-306], but the overall structural make-up is significantly different.
