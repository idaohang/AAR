The 1:1 proton-transfer brucinium compounds from the reaction of the alkaloid  brucine with 5-nitrosalicylic acid, 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid, and 5-sulfosalicylic acid,  namely anhydrous brucinium 5-nitrosalicylate (1), brucinium 3,5-dinitrosalicylate  monohydrate (2), and brucinium 5-sulfosalicylate trihydrate (3) have been prepared  and their crystal structures determined by X-ray crystallography. All structures further  demonstrate the selectivity of brucine for meta-substituted benzoic acids and comprise  three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded framework polymers. Two of the compounds (1  and 3) have the previously described undulating brucine sheet host-substructures  which incorporate interstitially hydrogen-bonded salicylate anion guest species and  additionally in 3 the water molecules of solvation. The structure of 2 differs in having  a three-centre bruciniumâ€“salicylate anion bidentate N+â€“HÂ·Â·Â·O(carboxyl) hydrogenbonding  association linking the species through interstitial associations involving also  the water molecules of solvation. A review of the crystallographic structural literature  on strychnine and brucine is also given.
