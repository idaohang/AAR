A combination of high resolution thermogravimetric analysis coupled to a gas evolution mass spectrometer combined with infrared emission spectroscopy has been used to study the thermal decomposition of synthetic hydrotalcites honessite (Ni6Fe2(SO4)(OH)16.4H2O) and mountkeithite (Mg6Fe2(SO4,CO3)(OH)16.4H2O) and the cationic mixtures of the two minerals. High resolution thermal analysis shows the decomposition takes place in 5 steps. A mass loss step is observed over the 125 to 150 degrees Celsius temperature range and is attributed to the mass loss due to dehydration. A second mass loss step is observed over the 260 to 330 degrees Celsius  temperature range and is attributed to dehydroxylation. The third mass loss occurs from 350 to 460 degrees Celsius, and is assigned to a loss of oxygen. The fourth mass loss step is ascribed to the loss of sulphate from the hydrotalcite and occurs over the 676 to 820 degrees Celsius  temperature range. A mechanism for the thermal decomposition is proposed based upon the loss of water, hydroxyl units, oxygen and sulphur dioxide.
