Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the molecular structure of a series of selected uranyl silicate minerals including uranophane, sklodowskite, cuprosklodowskite, boltwoodite and kasolite.  Raman spectra clearly show well resolved bands in the 750 to 800 cm-1 region and in the 950 to 1000 cm-1 region assigned to the Î½1 modes of the (UO2)2+ units and to the (SiO4)4- tetrahedra.  Sets of Raman bands in the 200 to 300 cm-1 region are assigned to Î½2 Î´ (UO2)2+ and UO ligand vibrations.  Multiple bands indicate the non-equivalence of the UO bonds and the lifting of the degeneracy of Î½2 Î´ (UO2)2+ vibrations. The (SiO4)4- tetrahedral are characterized by bands in the 470 to 550 cm-1 and in the 390 to 420 cm-1 region. These bands are attributed to the Î½4 and Î½2 (SiO4)4- bending modes.  The minerals show characteristic OH stretching bands in the 2900 to 3500 cm-1 and 3600 to 3700 cm-1 region ascribed to water stretching and SiOH stretching vibrations.  The high wavenumber position of the Î´H2O bands indicate strong hydrogen bonding of water in these uranyl silicates. Bands in the 1400 to 1550 cm-1 region are attributed to Î´SiOH modes.  The Raman spectroscopy of uranyl silicate minerals enabled separation of the bands attributed to distinct vibrational units. This enabled definitive assignment of the bands. The spectra are analysed in terms of the molecular structure of the minerals.
