The intercalation of a highly ordered kaolinite from Birdwood, South Australia has been studied using a combination of electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman microscopy.  Highly ordered kaolinites normally intercalate easily and to a high degree.  The kaolinite under study was found to intercalate acetamide and formamide with difficulty and more than 18 days were required to achieve more than 20 % intercalation.  Further treatment did not improve the degree of intercalation past 60 %.  The difficulty of intercalation is attributed to the co-existence of two kaolinite phases, a highly ordered (with a Hinckley index &gt; 1.3) and a highly disordered kaolinite, the latter material appears to coat the highly ordered kaolinite thereby limiting the intercalation.  The presence of two forms of silica and a dickite were identified in the sample using X-ray diffraction.
