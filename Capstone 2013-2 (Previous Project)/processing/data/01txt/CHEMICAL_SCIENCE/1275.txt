Basic aluminium sulphate and nitrate crystals were prepared by forced hydrolysis of aluminium salt solution followed by precipitation with a sulphate solution or by evaporation for the basic aluminium nitrate. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the chemical composition determined by ICP-AES in earlier work. High resolution XPS scans of the individual elements allow the identification of both the central IVAlO4 group and the 12 aluminium octahedra in the [IVAlO4AlVI(OH)24(H2O)12] building unit by two Al 2p transitions with binding energies of 73.7 and 74.2 eV in both the basic aluminium sulphate and nitrate. Four different types of oxygen atoms were identified in the basic aluminium sulphate associated with the central AlO4, OH, H2O and SO4 groups in the crystal structure with transitions at 529.4, 530.1, 530.7 and 531.8 eV, respectively.
