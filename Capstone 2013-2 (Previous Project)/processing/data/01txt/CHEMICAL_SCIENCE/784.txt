A suite of torbernites and metatorbernites have been analysed by Near-infrared spectroscopy.  The spectra of torbernites and metatorbernites in the first HOH fundamental overtone are different and the spectra of torbernites of different origins in the 6000 to 7500 cm-1 region vary.  NIR spectroscopy provides a method of studying the hydration of cations in the interlayer of torbernite.  NIR spectroscopy shows that the spectra of torbernites from different origins in the water HOH first fundamental overtone and combination regions are different.  This difference implies the hydration of cations is different for torbernite minerals. The structural arrangement of the water molecules in the interlayer is sample dependent.  The NIR spectra of metatorbernites are different from that of torbernites and a similarity of the spectra of metatorbernites suggests that the water structure in metatorbernites is similar.
