A series of tungstate bearing minerals including scheelite, stolzite ferberite, hÃ¼bnerite, wolframite, russellite, tungstenian wulfenite and cuprotungstite have been analysed by Raman microscopy.  The results of the Raman spectroscopic analysis are compared with published data. These minerals are closely related and often have related paragenesis. Raman microscopy enables the selection of individual crystals of these minerals for spectroscopic analysis even though several of the minerals can be found in the same matrix because of the pargenetic relationships between the minerals.  The Raman spectra are assigned according to factor group analysis and related to the structure of the minerals. These minerals have characteristically different Raman spectra. The ï¿®1(Ag) band is observed at 909 cm-1 and although the corresponding ï¿®1(Bu) vibration should be inactive a minor band is observed around 894 cm-1.  The bands at 790 and 881 cm-1 are associated with the antisymmetric and symmetric Ag modes of terminal WO2. The band at 695 cm-1 is interpreted as an antisymmetric bridging mode associated with the tungstate chain. The ï¿®4(Eg) band was absent for scheelite. The bands at 353 and 401 cm-1 are assigned as either deformation modes or as r(Bg) and ï¿¤(Ag) modes of terminal WO2. The band at   462 cm-1 has an equivalent band in the infrared at 455 cm-1 assigned as ï¿¤as(Au) of the (W2O4)n chain. The band at 508 cm-1 is assigned as ï¿®sym(Bg) of the (W2O4)n chain.
