Raman microscopy has been used to affirm the presence of wyartite  CaU5+(UO2)2(CO3)O4(OH)(H2O)7 in the presence of rabejacite  (Ca(UO2)4(SO4)2(OH)5.6H2O) obtained from the Ranger Mine, Northern Territory,  Australia. This occurrence is somewhat unusual in that it means that a uranyl  carbonate has been formed under acid conditions. Wyartite is a mineral known for the  occurrence of pentavalent U5+. 1 A band is observed at 818 cm-1 in the Raman  spectrum of wyartite assigned to the Î½2 symmetric bending mode of the (CO3)2- units.  The presence of carbonate is confirmed by the Î½1 stretching vibration at 1071 cm-1 and  the Î½3 stretching vibrations at 1445 and 1345 cm-1. Two bands are observed at 853  and 837 cm-1 and are assigned to the Î½1 stretching modes of the UO2 units. Raman  spectroscopy enables the partial band separation of the Î½2 (CO3)2- and Î½1 modes of  UO2. The Raman spectrum of rabejacite is characterised by an intense sharp band at  1010 cm-1 assigned to the Î½1 stretching mode of (SO4)2- . Three bands observed at  1086, 1123 and 1175 cm-1 are attributed to the Î½3 antisymmetric stretching modes of  (SO4)2-. The mineral rabejacite is also characterised by Î½2 bending modes at 457 and  394 cm-1 and Î½4 bending modes at 666, 605, 537 and 505 cm-1. Raman spectroscopy  has proven most useful for the detection of wyartite in the presence of other mineral  phases.
