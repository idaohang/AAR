We have previously shown in our previous investigations that the presence of oxygen is required for the benzene methylation with methane over zeolite catalysts in a high pressure batch reactor. Thus, a two-step mechanism involving the formation of methanol intermediate by methane partial oxidation followed by benzene methylation with methanol in the second step was postulated. This paper now presents the results of further investigation that provide more evidence that the catalytic benzene methylation with methane does occur and that the reaction is limited by the amount of oxygen. Further support is therefore given to the two-step oxidative reaction mechanism. Suggestions for further work in this area are also given.
