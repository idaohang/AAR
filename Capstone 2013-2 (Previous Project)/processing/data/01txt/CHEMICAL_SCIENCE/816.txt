The structure of a selection of arsenate and sulphate based minerals of the  tsumcorite group has been studied by the combination of Raman and infrared  spectroscopy. A comparison is made with the sulphate bearing mineral natrochalcite.  Isomorphic substitution of sulphate for arsenate is observed for gartrellite and  thometzekite. The position of the hydroxyl and water stretching vibrations are related  to the strength of the hydrogen bond formed between the OH unit and the AsO4 anion.  Estimates of the hydrogen bond distances are calculkated using a Libowitzky type  function. Characteristic Raman spectra of the minerals enable the assignment of the  bands to specific vibrational modes.
