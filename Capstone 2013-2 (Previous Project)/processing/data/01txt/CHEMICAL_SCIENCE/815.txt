Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the nature of gerhardtite, a  naturally occurring basic copper(II) nitrate of formula Cu2NO3(OH)3. Raman spectra  at 77 K show four bands at 3557, 3548, 3467 and 3409 cm-1 in accordance with the  crystal structure with three non-equivalent hydroxyl groups. Estimations of hydrogen  bond distances of 0.3019, 0.2987, 0.2855 and 0.2804 pm are obtained. Cooling to  liquid nitrogen temperatures did not affect these values. Two bands are observed at  1048 and 1052 cm-1 in the NO3 stretching region. Cooling to liquid nitrogen  temperature altered the ratio of these nitrates from 3/1 to 1/3. Two sets of bands in  the antisymmetric stretching region of the nitrate in the 77 K spectra suggest that there  are two non-equivalent nitrate anions in the gerhardtite structure at liquid nitrogen  temperature. X-ray crystallography suggests three independent oxygens in the one  nitrate group. The shift in band positions on obtaining Raman spectra at 298 and 77 K  indicates a phase change is occurring for the mineral upon cooling to 77 K.
