Raman spectroscopy of the mineral uranopilite at 298 and 77 K has been  obtained and used to elucidate the structure of the mineral at the molecular level. A  single intense band at 1010 cm-1 is assigned to the Î½1 (SO4)2- symmetric stretching  mode. Three low intensity bands in the 298 K Raman spectrum are observed at 1143,  1117 and 1097 cm-1and in the 77 K spectrum four bands at 1148, 1130, 1118 and  1106 cm-1. These bands are attributed to the Î½3 antisymmetric stretching modes. A  series of infrared bands are found at 1559, 1540, 1526 and 1511 cm-1 attributed to Î´  UOH bending modes. Three bands are observed at 843, 835 and 819 cm-1 in both 298  and 77 K spectra attributed to the Î½1 symmetric stretching modes of the (UO2)2+ units.  In the infrared spectra bands are observed at 941, 929 and 910 cm-1 and are assigned  to the Î½3 antisymmetric stretching modes of the UO2 units. These values are used to  calculate UO bond distances. Multiple OH stretching modes prove a complex  arrangement of OH groupings i.e. water molecules and OH- ions, and hydrogen  bonding in the crystal structure of uranopilite.
