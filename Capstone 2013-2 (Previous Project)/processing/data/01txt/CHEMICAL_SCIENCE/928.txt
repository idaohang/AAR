Syngenite (K2Ca(SO4)2.H2O), formed during treatment of manure with sulphuric acid, was studied by infrared, near-infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Cs site symmetry was determined for the 2 sulphate groups in syngenite (P21/m), so all bands are both infrared and Raman active. The split ï¿®1 (2 Raman + 2 infrared bands) was observed at 981 and 1000 cm-1. The split ï¿®2 (4 Raman + 4 infrared bands) was observed in the Raman spectrum at 424, 441, 471 and 491 cm-1. In the infrared spectrum only 1 band was observed at 439 cm-1. From the split ï¿®3 (6 Raman + 6 infrared) bands 3 298 K Raman bands were observed at 1117, 1138 and 1166 cm-1. Cooling to 77 K resulted in 4 bands at 1119, 1136, 1144 and 1167 cm-1. In the infrared spectrum 5 bands were observed at 1110, 1125, 1136, 1148 and 1193 cm-1. From the split ï¿®4 (6 infrared + 6 Raman bands) 4 bands were observed in the infrared spectrum at 604, 617, 644 and 657 cm-1. The 298 K Raman spectrum showed 1 band at 641 cm-1, while at 77 K 4 bands were observed at 607, 621, 634 and 643 cm-1. Crystal water is observed in the infrared spectrum by the OH-libration mode at 754 cm-1, OH-bending mode at 1631 cm-1, OH-stretching modes at 3248 (symmetric) and 3377 cm-1 (antisymmetric) plus a combination band at 3510 cm-1 of the H-bonded OH-mode plus the OH-stretching mode. The near-infrared spectrum gave information about the crystal water resulting in overtone and combination bands of OH-libration, OH-bending and OHâ€“stretching modes
