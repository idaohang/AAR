Vibrational spectroscopy using a combination of infrared and Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the uranyl micas also known as the autunite minerals, of general formula M(UO2)2(XO4)2.8-12H2O where M may be Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe2+, Mg, Mn2+ or Â½(HAl) and X is As, or P.  Included in these minerals are autunite, metautunite, torbernite, metatorbernite, metazeunerite, salÃ©eite and sabugalite. Compared with the results of infrared spectroscopy, Raman microscopy shows excellent band separation enabling the separation and identification of bands attributed to (UO2)2+ units, PO4 and AsO4 units.  Common to all spectra were bands at around 900 and 818 cm-1, attributed to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the (UO2)2+ units.  Water in autunites is in a highly structured arrangement in the interlayer of the uranyl micas. Water molecules are differentiated according to the strength of the hydrogen bonds formed between the water and the adjacent uranyl-phosphate or uranyl-arsenate surfaces and the hydration sphere of the interlayer cation.
