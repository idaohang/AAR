As the relevant colonial power, Australia played a significant role in the formation of the nation of Papua New Guinea. Australiaâ€™s colonial administration and its policies for social, economic and political development in the colony (Territory of Papua and New Guinea) directly influenced the setting of Papua New Guineaâ€™s national goals and directive principles. The Constitutional Planning Committee was responsible for the 'home-grown' Constitution of Papua New Guinea and recommended five national goals and directive principles to be integrated in the constitution. The vision for the national goals and directive principles differed from the prevailing social and economic culture previously disseminated by the colonial administration. The primary aim of this paper is to highlight Australia's role during the colonial period which influenced the Constitutional Planning Committee to recommend the National Goals and Directive Principles to be integrated into the constitution. These national goals were to be the corner-post for the social, economic and political development for the modern state of Papua New Guinea during the post-independence era.
