The present status of Pacific History in Australian schools is analysed and compared against earlier decades and against developments in the History curriculum of Pacific Island schools. After outlining obstacles facing teachers keen to introduce studies of the Pacific in their History classrooms, it is suggested that the commitment and professionalism of teachers will bring greater penetration across national and state curricula than top down prescription.  Discussion on variation in course design, appropriate content and awareness among teachers of recent historiography debates leads to reference to the many attempts made to promote with limited success, Pacific-related content in History curricula.
