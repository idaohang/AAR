This booklet was produced as a guide for History teachers in the Pacific Islands teaching History for the first time. It was distributed at no charge to teacher associations, institutions and schools. This material may be copied freely, with appropriate acknowledgement made to HistoryCOPs.  The manuscript was prepared at the HistoryCOPs regional workshop, held in Apia, Samoa, December 2000, and the VSSTA/HistoryCOPs workshop in Port Vila, Vanuatu, October 2001. Thanks also to Dr Brian Hoepper and Mr Ian Gray for their help in preparing the final draft.
