The orthodox view is that Samoa, a popular subject with magazine editors, postcard suppliers, photography studios and travelogue writers at the beginning of the 20th C, was imaged in simple dichotomies of life-in-nature against life-in-the-city and an archaic past against a modern present with a suggestion of capitalist economic expansion and paternal colonial development. Samoa was therefore imaged in â€œa few manageable and marketable clichÃ©s. These clichÃ©s consistently presented Samoans as primitive types inhabiting an unchanging Eden that did not participate in the Western world of technology, progress and time.â€¿   But the â€œSamoaâ€¿ found in the public domain of profusely illustrated magazines and serial encyclopedia the visual record from 1900 to 1940 challenges these academic categorizations.
