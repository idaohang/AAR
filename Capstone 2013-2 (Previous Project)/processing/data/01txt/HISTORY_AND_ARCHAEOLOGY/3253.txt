This chapter explores aspects of China's recent history via critical inquiry and is written for students in Years 10, 11 and 12. The chapter begins with the 'voices' of young Chinese students engaged in  dramatic action as a way of engaging students in  historical events. These 'voices' lead into a discovery narrative in which students investigate a key question through a mixture of stories and source-based inquiry.  Sets of questions guide students through the steps of critical inquiry and decision making. The chapter's content explores Chinese history via the perspective of the impact of significant events on Chinese women from 1900, and more recently, how globalisation has impacted on the lives of women in China. As with other chapters in this text, this chapter encourages students to probe global connections and make links between the events they investigate and their own lives.
