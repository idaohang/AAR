This chapter deals with four aspects of national identity and the integration of minorities in modern China. Each part explores aspects of national identity by focusing on the experiences of minority groups as they struggle to accept or refect a 'national identity'. Case studies are drawn from Tibet, Islamic nationalities,the Miao and Korean minorities who live in north-east China in the Yanbian region. Reference is also made briefly to the issue of national identity and the integration of minorities in Indonesia.
