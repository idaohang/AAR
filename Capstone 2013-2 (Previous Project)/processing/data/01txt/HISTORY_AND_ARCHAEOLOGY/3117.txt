This paper looks at the career of David Marshall during the years in which he was a  &quot;peripheral politician&quot;, as Chan Heng Chee has called him. It was in these years that  his commitment to the causes of human rights and civil rights in Singapore came to  the fore. During his career as an opposition politician and later as a barrister he  regularly championed the causes of freedom of speech and freedom of conscience in  Singapore. He stood against increasing odds for the rights of those who were detained  without trial and who were persecuted for their political beliefs.     His career between 1956 and 1972 saw him take a leading role in a number of  significant issues. These included his opposition to the governmentâ€™s move to  eliminate trial by jury in Singapore; his campaign for humane treatment for the  detainees of Operation Cold Store; and his defense of freedom of the press when  government critics were arrested, among other actions. This paper will look at  Marshallâ€™s role in these three occasions and evaluate his contribution to the practice  of politics in Singapore and will evaluate the long term impact of his defense of the  rule of law. It will be based on an examination of his speeches and on the materials in  the David Marshall papers.
