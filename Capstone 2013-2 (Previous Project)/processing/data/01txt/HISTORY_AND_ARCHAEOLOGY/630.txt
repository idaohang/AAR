On the small, raised coral island of Niue in the south Pacific, now with a population of less than 1200 due to the disastrous cyclone Heta in January 2004, there are thirty or so memorials, obelisks and plaques commemorating foreign missionaries, Niuean pastors, WWI and WWII veterans and Niue's relationship with New Zealand since 1901. These signify important events in Niue's history. But there are other histories of Niue. The distant and recent past on Niue is contained in gestures, honorifics, modes of gender and age respect, set-piece oratories for conflict resolution, and in words, songs, dance-drama and genealogical and mythological narratives. These essentially Niuean behaviours are shaped by indigenous epistemologies or Niuean ways of thinking, creating and conveying knowledge.
