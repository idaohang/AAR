There has long been a problematic relationship between the Chinese and opium. The issues so far as most historians have been concerned, however, have revolved around a limited range of issues. Much work has been done on the opium trade to China in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; the â€œopium warsâ€¿ between China and Britain; and the campaigns to suppress the opium trade to and in China around the end of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century. Until recently, there have been relatively few studies of the opium trade in the context of the Chinese diaspora, particularly within Southeast Asia. I argue here that opium, both the opium trade and opium use, have played a major part in the formation of the culture, economy and politics of the Chinese in Southeast Asia. I would like, with these general remarks, to sketch in a number of these influences and their long-term significance for the history of the Chinese presence in the region.
