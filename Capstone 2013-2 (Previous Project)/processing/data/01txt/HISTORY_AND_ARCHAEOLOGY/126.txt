In many ways, the current wave of â€˜anti-Americanismâ€™ is nothing new. Much of the post-Cold War criticism directed towards American foreign policy by certain sections of the Australian community bears a striking resemblance to those expressed by Americans, and non-Americans alike, during the Cold War itself. Anti-Americanism, as this paper and others have defined it, is less that of an critical attitude based upon both empirical evidence and an appreciation of history than it is an ideologically driven, oftentimes hateful outlook, characterised by a simplistic belief that American policymakers are mean-spirited, racist, and essentially evil. What is intriguing is the fact that these expressions mirror many of those assumptions driving the Cold War paradigm of â€˜New Left Revisionismâ€™ that came to prominence in the United States during the late 1960â€™s and was part of the evolution of Cold War interpretation precipitated by the rise of Cold War â€˜Realismâ€™. Whilst the nature and intensity of the Realist and New Left critiques differs to that put forth by proponents of anti-Americanism today, this essay demonstrates that the continuity between this post-Cold War phenomenon and the evolution of Cold War interpretation is indeed remarkable.
