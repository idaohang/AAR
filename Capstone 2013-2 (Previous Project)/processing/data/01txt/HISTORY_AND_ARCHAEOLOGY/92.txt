The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 24 March 1824 was signed partly to legitimize British control of  Singapore, and also to settle outstanding issues between the British and Dutch following the Napoleonic Wars. It effectively divided the Malay world down the Straits of Melaka.  It gave the Dutch Sumatra and the islands to the south of the Straits of Singapore, while the British received the Malay Peninsula and Singapore Island. This paper examines the history of this border and the development of a new consciousness about borders, mapping and territoriality among Southeast Asian peoples in the Malay world between 1800 and the early 20th century
