During the years of the White Australia Policy Chinese families struggled to survive on the margins of mainstream Australian society.  The attitudes of Chinese parents and grandparents towards dealing with the outside world and becoming part of mainstream society, and the strategies they developed for doing this successfully, had significant impact not only on the survival of the family but also on the lives and identities of the second- and third-generation.  Using an interdisciplinary approach and drawing from the personal narratives of multi-generational Chinese Australians, this paper explores the role of family as â€˜gatekeepersâ€™ of the boundaries between the Chinese home and wider society.  It considers the effect of this â€˜gatekeepingâ€™ on the opportunities and constraints experienced by the second- and third-generation in terms of gaining access to and functioning successfully in mainstream Australian life.  At the same time it looks at the multifarious ways in which diverse meanings attached to â€˜Chinesenessâ€™ shifted across generations as second- and third-generation Chinese Australians re-invented and re-constructed â€˜Chinesenessâ€™ in ways that were relevant and meaningful for them.
