When the tsarist regime was abruptly swept from power in Russia by the revolution of February 191 7, thereafter, the revolution itself represented a new and serious rival to th-e Great War, which had commanded most of the countryâ€™s energy and attention since hostilities commenced in July 1914. The introduction of this unexpected rival to t h e war was an event of such consequence, in fact, that it immediately complicated the nationâ€™s internal and foreign affairs.  Russiaâ€™s wartime allies certainly saw the February Revolution in such terms and,  accordingly, they directed their efforts toward keeping Russia in the war and sustaining-her war effort. Thus, Allied representatives in Russia were at pains to convince t h e Russians of the necessity of continuing the war with the Central Powers and, also, to persuade them to accord top priority to their war effort which, of course implied consequent restrictions on the development of the revolution, Russiaâ€™s wartime enemies were also perceptive of this situation, however, and their concern to promote the further development of the revolution, to the detriment of the war effort, was obvious in the role which Germany performed in aiding Leninâ€™s return to Russia from Switzerland in April 1917,Russian opinion itself â€˜was diverse.   Generally, it ranged from the Bolsheviksâ€™ position, which advocated absolute priority to the revolution and an end to a war which they had never supported, to that of the military leadership who, being responsible for the conduct of the war, largely favoured the Allied viewpoint and opposed any concessions to the revolution which might weaken Russiaâ€™s war effort. which broad had formed after the collapse range of popular opinion and,of tsarist authority, therefore, pledged I he Provisional Government was anxious to represent the itself to continue the war and  give impetus to the revolution. The Bolshevik position finally prevailed, however, with The Russian General Staff in 1917 their seizure of power from the Provisional Government in October I917 and the subsequent treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 191 8, whereby Russia withdrew from the war, Thus, the revolution won absolute priority over the war and, perhaps, inevitably so. The purpose of this paper is to examine the attitudes of the generals who served successively as Commander-in-Chief of Russiaâ€™s armed forces in 19.1 7 - Alexeyev , Srusilov and Kornilov - to the vexed question of how to maintain the war effort as an Allied power in the Great War in the midst of the revolutionary turmoil affecting the nation.
