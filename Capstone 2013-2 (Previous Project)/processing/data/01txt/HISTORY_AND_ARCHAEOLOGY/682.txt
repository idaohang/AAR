This paper looks broadly at the changing fortunes of the Chinese water frontier in Southern Vietnam over a 200 year period between the late seventeenth century and the end of the nineteenth century. Initially an area of sparse settlement, Chinese settlers, first Ming refugees and later waves of pirates, planters and traders moved into the Mekong Delta and south eastern Siam to create a vibrant and influential economic centre in the region. By the end of the nineteenth century these areas were largely backwaters of little more than subregional significance. Within the same 200-year period, however, the Chinese presence in Southeast Asia had increased by a phenomenal degree, and completely new centres of activity had been established.
