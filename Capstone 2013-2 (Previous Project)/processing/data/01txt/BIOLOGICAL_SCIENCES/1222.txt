This study evaluated the effect of bacterial physiology, such as physiological age and  stress, on the performance of the Ultravioloet Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (UV-APS,  model 3312, TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN). Intensity of the fluorescent signals was measured  for three bacteria having various sensitivities to environmental stresses, Bacillus subtilus  (spores and vegetative cells), Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Micrococcus luteus. The  performance of the UVAPS was found to depend on the type of airborne bacteria. In  addition, the fluorescence signals for stationary-phase bacteria were generally stronger  than for their log-phase counterparts. These results indicated that bacterial injury due to  environmental stresses has a strong influence on the measured fluorescence signals. This  hypothesis was confirmed by obtaining a linear relationship between the percentage of  fluorescent particles and the proportion of injured bacteria in the total population of  cultivable bacteria in samples simultaneously collected with the AGI-30 impingers. This  indicates that the amount of fluorophors (specifically NADH) within injured bacteria is  below the UVAPS sensitivity level. The practical implications of these findings are  discussed in the paper. The reported results contribute to broadening our understanding of  the method and may assist in developing sampling strategies for the application of the  UVAPS to various bioaerosol studies.
