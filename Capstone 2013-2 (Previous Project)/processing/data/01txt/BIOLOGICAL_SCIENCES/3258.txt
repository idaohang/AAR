Oviposition deterrence is common in many insects as an evolutionary mechanism to reduce subsequent larval competition.  We investigated a suspected case of oviposition deterrence by the paropsine chrysomelid, Chrysophtharta bimaculata.  In paired choice tests, gravid females were found to prefer ovipositing on host leaves without conspecific eggs, confirming the presence of an apparent oviposition deterrence mechanism.  Washing egg batches in water, hexane or ethanol did not change this preference, suggesting that a soluble marking pheromone was not involved.  Furthermore, it is unlikely that a plant derived oviposition deterring substance is produced as beetles showed no significant oviposition preference between leaves which had been oviposited upon, but then had the eggs removed, and those that had never been oviposited upon. In trials using artificial leaves and mimic egg batches, â€˜leavesâ€™ with â€˜egg batchesâ€™ placed near the tip of the leaf (the preferred site of oviposition in this species) were significantly less likely to be laid upon than artificial leaves where mimic eggs were placed away from the tip.  In combination, the results strongly infer that oviposition deterrence in C. bimaculata is due to the mechanical blocking of the oviposition site by the first laid egg-batch, rather than a specific oviposition deterring cue.  The apparent oviposition deterrence in this insect may well be an outcome or evolutionary effect of oviposition-site selection, rather than a clear adaptive mechanism to decrease larval competition.
