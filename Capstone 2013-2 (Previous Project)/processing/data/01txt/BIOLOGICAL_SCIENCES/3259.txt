Frugivorous dacine fruit flies were studied in a lowland tropical rain forest in Papua New Guinea to determine their host specificity, abundance, and the number of species attacking various plant species. Plant species hosted 0 â€“ 3 fruit fly species at median (1 - 3 quartile) densities of 1 (0 - 17) fruit flies per 100 fruits. Fruit flies were mostly specialised to a single plant family (83% species) and within each family to a single genus (88% species), while most of the species (66%) were able to feed on &gt;1 congeneric plant species. Only 30 from the 53 studied plant species were colonised by fruit flies. The plant-fruit fly food web including these 30 plant species and the total of 29 fruit fly species feeding on them was divided into 14 compartments, each including 1 - 8 plant species hosting mutually disjunct assemblages of fruit flies. This structure minimises indirect interactions among plant species via shared herbivores. The local species pool was estimated at 152  32 (SE) fruit fly species. Forty percent of all taxonomically described species known from Papua New Guinea were reared or trapped in our study area. Such high proportion indicates low beta-diversity of fruit flies. Steiner traps were highly efficient in sampling the lure-responsive fruit fly species as they re-collected 84% of all species trapped in the same area 5 years before. Fruit fly monitoring by these traps is a cheap, simple and efficient method for the study of spatial and temporal changes in rain forest communities.
