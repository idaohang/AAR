An understanding is provided on how the existing freight transport modes share the Australian freight task, which provided further insight into the corridor mode selection process. It is important to compare modes across all relevant determinants and performance indicators considering the viewpoint of all parties, in order to better understand the mode selection process.  	The Brisbane â€“ Cairns corridor in Queensland, Australia is used as a case-study to gain an understanding of how each freight mode is currently being used in the line haul freight task along the corridor.  This provides a basis for investigating the nature and values of specific freight mode choice determinants and performance indicators for this corridor.
