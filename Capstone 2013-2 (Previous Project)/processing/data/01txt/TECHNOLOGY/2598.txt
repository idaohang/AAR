This paper proposes a statistical model for the total multiple access interference (MAI) power for both Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) and Multicarrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) systems. We consider the use of both Walsh-Hadamard (WH) and Gold spreading codes transmitting over the asynchronous uplink channel. Detailed signal models of both CDMA systems are derived illustrating the production of MAI under asynchronous conditions. The paper demonstrates the Gaussian nature of the total MAI and shows that the probability density function (pdf) of the total MAI power can be very accurately characterized by the Nakagami-m distribution.
