Construction of high-rise concrete buildings relies extensively on multi-level formworking; a process in which a limited number of formwork and shoring sets are cycled up the structure as construction progresses. This multi-level formworking procedure relies on supporting a freshly cast slab on a number of lower level slabs, which may or may not have attained their full strength. Currently, the multi-level formwork shoring procedure and slab construction cycle times for buildings with post-tensioned slabs are selected based on the requirements for conventionally reinforced slabs. As such, cycle times of 4 or 5 days and 3 or 4 levels of shoring are common. This paper proposes, however, that due to the inherently different behavior of post-tensioned slabs, it may be possible to shorten slab cycle times, reduce formwork and shoring materials and improve construction safety.
