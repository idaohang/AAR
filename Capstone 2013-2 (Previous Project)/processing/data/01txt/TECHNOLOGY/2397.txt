Researchers at Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane, Australia) are studying the impacts of multi-combination vehicles, such as the popular 25m B-double, on arterial road trafï¬¿c operation. A PhD project is examining the impact of MCVs on trafï¬¿c progression along the Brisbane Urban Corridor, which includes Riawena and Kessells Roads, while a Masters project is examining the lateral position impacts on a section of the Gateway Motorway.
