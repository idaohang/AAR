Cadastral mapping has traditionally relied upon well-established cadastral survey techniques of traversing and radiation. The equipment used to accomplish these surveys has evolved since the 1970s from optical theodolites and steel bands, to total stations and data recorder technology. With recent advances in satellite technologies, space-based positioning systems are now becoming capable of replacing conventional survey methods for many survey applications, especially when striving for consistent sub-centimetre three-dimensional positioning.  Survey measurements undertaken in the real-world environment begin to lose their integrity from the time of observation due to movement of marks and the ground that holds them. This integrity degradation results from movements of the monumentation marks and the ground itself within which holds these marks.An emphasis of this research undertaking has been to investigate the possibilities and potential that new GPS technology approaches can contribute towards describing rural property boundaries. Improved boundary description methods will lead to improved integrity of the rural cadastre in a Queensland land administration environment.
