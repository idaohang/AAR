Privatized airports are emerging as significant transportation and logistics hubs competing with traditional CBDs as activity centres with significant environmental, social and economic impacts. The major implications for transportation planning and evaluation of options have been highlighted as: the difficulty in arriving at an agreed set of relative weights to be attached to each objective; the need to undertake any interface analysis at the regional scale; the need to model the complex nature of the interaction between mixed land use activities within the emerging airport precinct and the supply, pricing and regulation of the relevant transportation links; and the relevance of 'option value' concepts when evaluating transit access to airports.
