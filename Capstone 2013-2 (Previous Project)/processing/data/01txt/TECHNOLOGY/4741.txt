During the last two decades the public sector has come under increasing pressure to improve performance and demonstrate greater transparency and accountability.  This pressure has resulted in public sector organisations facing shifts in ways of operating.  Various corporate change strategies have been adopted by different public sector agencies, many of these cloning managerial practices from the private sector.  These changes in public sector organisations have enormous significance for regional economic and social development.  While there is a growing body of knowledge dealing with the management of corporate change there are still significant gaps in understanding the process.  While there is much written on public versus private corporate change, there is little distinguishing between change in different types of public sector organisations.  This paper analyses change management processes and seeks to determine whether a hybrid model of â€˜new public managementâ€™ delivers more favourable outcomes than a model focused on cost reduction and private sector prejudice for the bottom line.
