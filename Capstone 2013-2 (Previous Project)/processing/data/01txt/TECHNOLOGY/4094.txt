Students recommence Semester One 2000 on the 28th February.  Several mid-year entry students have been undertaking the PSB640 Surveying unit over the third semester (December-January) to accelerate their coursework studies. The Design and Construction Studies Research Concentration recently held a one-day event to highlight postgraduate research being conducted in the DESCON unit. DESCON consists mostly of researchers from the Schools of Planning, Landscape Architecture, and Surveying; Construction Management; and Architecture, Interior and Industrial Design. The day was very successful and thanks go to Tim Baker for organising the event.
