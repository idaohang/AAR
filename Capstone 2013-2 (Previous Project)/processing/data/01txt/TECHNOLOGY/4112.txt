What constitutes unacceptable client behaviour in competitive tendering is considered based on theoretical, legislative and moral considerations.  A range of malpractices is then identified through the examination of reported abuses.  Finally, a case study is presented which illustrates some of these practices and the difficulties faced by those affected in offering resistance.  It is suggested that a practical solution may found by requiring clients to make a more direct contribution to tenderers costs.
