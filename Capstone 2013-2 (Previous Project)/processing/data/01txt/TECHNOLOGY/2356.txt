Multi-combination vehicles (MCV) are road freight vehicles with a prime mover towing two or more trailers. The proposed research aims to understand how lane width requirements are influenced by the sideways movements of the trailers (lateral displacement or tracking ability), the lateral position of the prime mover and the behavioural characteristics of the drivers of surrounding vehicles. The research includes two full scale testing programs. Firstly, MCV tracking ability will be determined by extending the previous work of Lennie, Haldane and Bunker (2003) on rural lane widths. Secondly, testing on an urban arterial road or motorway will be conducted to yield information on the lateral position and behaviour of surrounding drivers. This paper provides a background to the study and the proposed methodology.
