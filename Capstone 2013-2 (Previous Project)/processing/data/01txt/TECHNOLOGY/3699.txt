So as to bring the unique talents of various construction industry project participants together in a more productive and integrated manner, the Online Remote Construction Management (ORCM) project commenced in July 1999 proposing to test, field trial and/or evaluate the implementation of various Internet-based Construction Project Management (ICPM) systems and information and communication technologies (ICT) on four case study projects over a two-year period. This paper provides final results obtained from two ORCM Surveys implemented on these case study projects. â€˜Best Practice Recommendationsâ€™ are identified offering a positive contribution to the successful implementation of ICT tools and ICPM systems on remote construction projects. Additional research and benchmark activities were undertaken on the four ORCM case study projects and will be considered in future papers.
