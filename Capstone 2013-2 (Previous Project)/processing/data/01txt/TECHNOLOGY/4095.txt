Surveying and Mapping studies will be under an improved organisational structure of the new &quot;SCHOOL OF DESIGN AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT&quot; within the Faculty of Built Environment and Engineering.  The combination of Design and Built Environment disciplines with one administrative support unit will create new exciting opportunities for cross-disciplinary projects, particularly in the land development and spatial sciences area.
