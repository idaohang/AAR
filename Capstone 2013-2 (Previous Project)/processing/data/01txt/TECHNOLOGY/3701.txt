In an attempt to bring the unique talents of various construction industry project participants together in a more productive and integrated manner, the Online Remote Construction Management (ORCM) project commenced in July 1999 proposing to test, field trial and/or evaluate the implementation of various Internet-based Construction Project Management (ICPM) systems and information and communication technologies (ICT) on four case study projects (CS 1 to 4) over a two-year period, aiming, in general, to demonstrate leadership in facilitating the use of online technologies for the design, management and construction of building and civil construction projects.  This paper provides (a) final results obtained from two ORCM Surveys implemented on the four CS projects and (b) a list of â€˜Best Practice Guidelinesâ€™ that are critical in helping ensure successful implementation of ICT tools and/or ICPM systems on geographically dispersed (remote) civil and building construction projects. These â€˜Best Practice Guidelinesâ€™ help reinforce the need for further research and development (R&amp;D) of (a) innovative ICT tools and ICPM systems, (b) identifying ways to overcome industry cultural â€˜barriersâ€™ and â€˜modifyingâ€™ traditional work â€˜habitsâ€™; and (c) identifying improved implementation procedures and application opportunities within the construction industry. Unfortunately, regardless of ICTs (via the Web) being perceived by many as being convenient, inexpensive, and fast, it cannot be conclusively determined whether the Web influenced the nature of communications between the project participants or not.
