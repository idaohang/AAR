Web-based collaboration platforms present construction project teams with an opportunity to improve the efficiency of document exchange, better control project communications and enhance team collaboration. However, many construction professionals are still not convinced that these platforms, in their current form, are fit-for-purpose and yield sufficient efficiencies for the construction procurement process. In an attempt to improve the current ICT diffusion process, this paper evaluates the implementation of a web-based collaboration tool on the Lane Cove Tunnel (LCT) project in Sydney, Australia. Moreover, the paper provides strategies for achieving more effective implementation of web-based collaboration platforms in the construction sector.
