Unlike many other industries, construction is highly fragmented with numerous design firms, consultants, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers involved in almost any project. Due to the construction industry not having a coherent and integrated computer system that encompasses the whole of the construction process from design through construction to final account and facilities management, even though the today's technology can make this possible, data exchange between project participants is still largely undertaken on paper. In an attempt to bring the unique talents of various construction industry project participants together in a more productive and integrated manner, the Online Remote Construction Management (ORCM) project commenced in July 1999 proposed to test, field trial and/or evaluate inline information and communications systems on up to 5 case study projects over the 2-year period. The ORCM research project aims to demonstrate leadership in facilitating the use of online technologies for the design, management and construction of building and civil construction projects, by identifying and implementing appropriate communication and information technology solutions that will ultimately improve resource management, support and integrate total project life cycle considerations, increase efficiencies on projects, reduce overall cost and improve project outcomes. This paper provides final results, findings and recommendations obtained through the implementation of two ORCM Surveys on one of five ORCM case study projects investigated.
