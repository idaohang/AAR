The nature of property valuation/analysis is examined in respect of the property market and, in particular, the extent of property market analysis undertaken by practitioners when carrying out property valuations.  An empirical survey is described of a sample of 240 valuers throughout Australia and their practices in valuing investment grade property.  It is shown that, although the valuers are fully aware of the need for property market analysis, and collect appropriate data to do the analysis, the analysis itself is seldom conducted in other than a cursory manner.
