This paper investigates experiential learning theory and the current perception of experiential factors in the accuracy of pre-tender cost prediction.  It compares the preferred learning styles of a sample of experienced pre-tender cost estimators with those of novice quantity surveyors and investigates how estimators have developed as a result of their experiences.  Experiential factors, those which stimulate personal development in pre-tender estimators, are considered and a mechanism to improve the accuracy of pre-tender estimates is proposed linking experiential learning theory with the introduction of feedback and self monitoring systems.
