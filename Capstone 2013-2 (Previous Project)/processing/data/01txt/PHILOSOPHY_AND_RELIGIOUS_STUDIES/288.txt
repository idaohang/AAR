This paper reports on research with women inmates undertaking prison education in twoQueensland correctional facilities: Brisbane Women's Correctional Centre and Helena Jones Community Corrections Centre. This study investigated inmate women's accounts of  education using interview data. The research found that women's involvement in prison education identified institutional and cultural limitations concerning women's access to, and participation in, prison education programs. These accounts attested variously to the embeddedness of their educational experiences within these constraints. This work recommends, as a research policy imperative, changes to structural and cultural dimensions of prison education to support women inmatesâ€™ educational access and experiences.
