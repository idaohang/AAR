The globalization debate of the nineties has given way recently to the concept and reality of empire. The ground for the shift was prepared by the increasing attention paid to military globalization as opposed to the neo-liberal paradise of a borderless world. Not only is the state back, but the state is back in its most military and most externally-oriented form in discussions of empire. Yet there are increasing difficulties in employing the seemingly obsolescent concept of empire. Must this concept undergo merely a series of cosmetic transformations given the underlying reality of state power and power politics or is a postmodern transformation of the concept either desirable or possible? In this paper the juridical transformation of the concept as envisaged by Hardt and Negri is analysed in the context of the interpretation of the NATO intervention in Kosovo as an event in the foundation of a new world order.
