In educational research, theses are still expected to support the myth that learning which will advance knowledge about education is almost exclusively the product of abstract and systematic logical processes, of a disembodied spirit.  In my PhD thesis, I demonstrated that a significant role was played in the construction of my knowledge by my body[-mind], much of it initially outside my awareness.  This paper will address the tensions between dualistic traditions of our culture (cf. Wertheim, 1999) and new ways of understanding how people come to know what they know (e.g., Damasio, 1994; Lear, 1998; Lemke, 1995; Maturana &amp; Varela, 1992; Sacks, 1998), and apply them to issues of research methodology and thesis presentation.
