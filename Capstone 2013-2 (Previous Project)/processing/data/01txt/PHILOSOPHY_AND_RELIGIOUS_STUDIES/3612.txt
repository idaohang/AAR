The commonalities between critical realism and the theological science of Wolfhart Pannenberg are examined. It is suggested that the commonalities exist in the following areas: 1) the programme of revelation-as-history and the implications of this for a philosophy-of-history, 2) the view of the resurrection of Jesus as event, 3) the approaches to understanding Jesus in history, 4) the relationship of theology to philosophy-of-science, and 5) the understanding of God as the all-determining reality. It is suggested that within the theological science of Wolfhart Pannenberg one might find some theological foundations for critical realism, or at least some scope for future dialogue.
