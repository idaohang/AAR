The assessment of mental capacity to assist legal determinations of competency is potentially a growth area for neuropsychology, although to date neuropsychologists have published relatively little in this area.  In this paper a systematic review of methods used to assess capacity is presented, including coverage of specialised tests and interviews used for this purpose.  A neuropsychological model for conducting capacity assessments is proposed.  This model involves comprehensive assessment of a wide range of cognitive abilities as well as assessment of specific skills and knowledge related to the type of capacity being assessed.  The purpose of proposing this model is to stimulate further discussion and debate about the contribution neuropsychologists might make in this area.
