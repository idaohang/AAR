Review of the available literature, from various countries, on housing  options indicates that, for people with a mental illness, boarding houses are  the least desirable type of community accommodation and that living in their  own home is the most desirable type of accommodation. The present research  project provides a more in-depth examination of people with schizophrenia  and the impact of living in their own home compared to living in a boarding  house. In this Australian study there were 3231 subjects, 3033 who were living  in their own homes and 201 living in boarding house accommodation. The study  used two instruments from the Mental Health Classification and Service Cost  Project, specifically the Health of the Nation Outcomes Scale, which is a  measure  of current symptoms, and a shortened version of the Life Skills Profile, which  measures global level of functioning. Results indicated that while there were no  differences in the level of psychiatric symptoms experienced, people living in  boarding houses had less access to social support, meaningful activities and  work;  they also had a significantly lower level of global functioning.These findings  contradict the conventional wisdom that people with schizophrenia resort to  living in boarding houses because of their level of disability and highlights  an area of potential intervention for community health services.
