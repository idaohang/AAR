Background: Intensive care patients with a central venous catheter are at risk of catheter-related infection, which increases morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Infection control practices, including care of the intravenous administration sets and catheter site, are undertaken by nurses in an attempt to avoid infection. Although practice guidelines are available, anecdotal reports suggest that infection control practices vary between practitioners and institutions; however, current practice has not been formally surveyed.    Aim: To evaluate the current infection control practices for central venous catheter care and to compare these to evidence-based practice guidelines.     Design: Prospective, cross-sectional descriptive survey.    Method: Intensive care units (n=14) from Australia were surveyed about their infection control policies for central venous catheter care. Results were tabulated and compared with evidence-based practice guidelines (Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections, Centers for Disease Control [CDC], United States).    Results: A wide variety of responses were received regarding duration of administration set use for standard, parenteral nutrition and propofol infusions; ad hoc administration set connection technique; dressing frequency, materials and solutions; and barrier precautions used during procedures. There was inconsistent adherence to the CDC Guidelines.    Conclusions: There is currently great variation in the infection control approach to central venous catheter care. Greater adherence to existing CDC Guidelines would assist in the standardisation of best practice and facilitate evidence-based care.
