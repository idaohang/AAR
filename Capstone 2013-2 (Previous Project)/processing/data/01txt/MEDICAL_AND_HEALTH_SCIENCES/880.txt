Six fungal species (Fusarium sp, Exophiala jeanselmei, Penicillium spp, Aspergillus niger, Paecilomyces spp, and Alternaria spp) were used to inoculate soft contact lenses. Four types of soft lenses were used: high-water (58%) and low-water (38%) content lenses and lenses that were unworn or worn for 1 day. The fungi displayed a range of macroscopic and microscopic features that allowed differentiation of species. There was no statistically significant effect of lens water content on growth rate and only Penicillium spp showed significantly higher growth for worn versus unworn lenses. A number of the fungi showed secretions, thought to be enzymes, which potentially aid in the process of lens penetration. Â© Elsevier Science Inc. 2000
