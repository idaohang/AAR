Part 1 of this paper explored the premise that a role predicament of caring exists within family caregiving relationships. It was argued that dysfunctional patterns of communication develop in family caregiving relationships not only in response to stereotypical expectations about older people but also in response to stereotypical expectations of both caregiver and carereceiver concerning their role in the caregiving relationship. The argument was grounded in data contained within a large comprehensive study of older people and their family caregivers. This paper builds on the earlier contention and holds that more productive and effective forms of communication and caregiving relationships can be promoted through modification of role expectations and behaviours. The Health Promoting Communication Model is introduced and proposed as an appropriate framework for guiding both prevention and intervention strategies for health promoting communication in family caregiving.
