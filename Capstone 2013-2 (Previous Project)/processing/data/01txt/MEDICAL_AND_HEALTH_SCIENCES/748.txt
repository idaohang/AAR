The monochromatic aberrations of the human eye limit visual performance to varying degrees. An aberroscope or a Hartman-Shack sensor can measure the total aberrations of the human eye. The aberroscope that is currently being developed at the Centre for Eye Research consists of a grid pattern that is projected on the eye through a specially designed optical system and a camera that records the resulting grid image from the retina. We propose the development of an integrated DSP system that would simultaneously control the projected grid pattern and capture the retinal images. Also, we derive a detection scheme for calculating the centroids of the retinal grid pattern. These centroids are used to determine the wavefront aberration error function of the human eye. The ability to rapidly acquire multiple patterns/images increases the accuracy of the monochromatic aberration estimates.
