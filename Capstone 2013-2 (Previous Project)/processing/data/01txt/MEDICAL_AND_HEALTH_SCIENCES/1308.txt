Housing has been identified as a crucial component of successful community living for people with schizophrenia. Unfortunately, many mental health services only focus on acute care and drug solutions for their clients. This grounded theory study aimed to develop a theoretical understanding of the impact of housing on the mental health of people with schizophrenia. Data were collected from thirteen people with schizophrenia who were living in boarding houses (considered the least suitable housing) or living in their own home (considered the most suitable housing). Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore the participantsâ€™ experiences and views of the impact of their housing on their mental health.   Findings indicated that participants living in their own homes have access to more opportunities and resources for staying well than people with schizophrenia living in boarding houses. Findings also indicated a strong desire amongst all participants to live in their own home. When they do have this opportunity they make choices that enhance their ability to stay well.
