A model that can be used to estimate the optimum water content thickness relationship for a hydrogel contact lens of a given power is presented. The model Is based on estimates of the minimum practical center thickness to which hydrogel lenses may currently bemanufactured and average thickness calculations. Minimum thickness lenses of water contents in the range of 65-70% are calculated to provide optimal oxygen transmissibility to the central corneal areafor a wide range of powers. Although a lack of understanding of the oxygen delivery characteristics of hydrogel lenses places limitations on the accuracy of this model, it represents a significant advance over earlier proposals.
