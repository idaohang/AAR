Using the term &quot;ecological validity&quot;, in a recent issue of Ecological Psychology, Rogers et al. (2005) discussed how the simulator they used could provide data by replicating natural road driving behaviors. However, ecological validity, as Egon Brunswik (1956) conceived it, refers to the validity of a cue (i.e., perceptual variable) in predicting a criterion state of the environment. Like other psychologists in the past, Rogers et al. (2005) confused this term with another of Brunswikâ€™s terms: representative design. In this comment we clarify the distinction between these concepts and also discuss how Gibsonian ideas can strengthen understanding of the correspondence between experimental task constraints and behavioral settings outside the laboratory. The main implication of this theoretical rationalization is for the development of a measurable correspondence between experimental and behavioural contexts, enabling defensible generalization to both organisms and environments beyond the bounds of particular experiments.
