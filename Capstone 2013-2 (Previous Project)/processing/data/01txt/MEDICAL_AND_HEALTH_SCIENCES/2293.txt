Although the media has highlighted some traumatic consequences of school bullying, such as victim suicide, and research has shown the negative effects of bullying, the long term traumatic consequences have not been as well researched. The literature  generally considers school victims to be bullied by peers, however, it has been demonstrated that some trauma to students in schools involves teachers and other school personnel (Hyman &amp; Snook, 2000). A unique aspect for this study, is that it explored school trauma beyond an understanding of specific situations and locations in which bullying occurred to a more comprehensive view of types of trauma experienced by students. The Student Alienation and Trauma Scale-Revised (SATS-R, 2002) was used with 95 undergraduates to develop bullying profiles. It was found that although peers were involved in most respondentsâ€™ worst school experience, a significant proportion of worst school experiences remembered by participants involved teachers. Negative social situations rather than negative physical experiences were the most recalled. The implications for teachers and schools are discussed.
