The growing demand for palliative care means that health professionals are expected to provide palliative care as a core part of their practice.    Training in the practice of palliative care is a recent addition to undergraduate and postgraduate medical and other healthcare curricula, and several initiatives are under way to promote palliative care principles and practice in healthcare training.    The challenge that we all face is how to develop these skills in the face of multiple demands on our time.    Strategies for improving palliative care education include a national undergraduate curriculum for palliative care, expanded training opportunities for generalist practitioners, and further recognition for the role of practitioners of specialist palliative care and associated curriculum development.    In the 21st century, providing palliative care is an obligatory component of health services. As a community, we expect that, when prolongation of life is neither possible nor appropriate, effective care and support will still be available as palliative care. Virtually all health workers who come into contact with patients require some knowledge of both the unique needs of people facing death, and their own responses to these needs. The extent of this knowledge ranges from simple awareness of the availability of palliative care through to the highly specialised skills required for referral practice. Here we discuss the educational and training needs of medical, nursing or allied health professionals who provide primary care with a palliative approach, or specialist palliative care services.
