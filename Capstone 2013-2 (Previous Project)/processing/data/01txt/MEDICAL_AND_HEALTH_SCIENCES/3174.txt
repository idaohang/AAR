Contact lens wear generally induces changes of corneal curvature as measured with the keratometer. Previous studies have considered only one dimension of the curvature change or the fir of the lens. This paper introduces a graphical system in which a co-ordinate system is used to express two dimensions of the lens to cornea fitting relationship. A vector from the initial mode of fit point gives a two dimensional expression of curvature change. There are suggestions on statistical analyses of data plotted on this graphical system.
