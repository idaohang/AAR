Purpose: A qualitative study was conducted in Brisbane, Queensland to explore the lived experiences of sixteen older carers who each provide care for a family member with chronic mental illness. The purpose of the study was to provide insight into the lived experiences of these carers and their perceptions of how caring for a mentally ill family member has affected their sense of well-being.    Methodology: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with each participant.    Findings: Many carers perceived that their experiences of caring for a mentally-ill family member have had a significant impact upon their physical and emotional well-being, and most felt that they had lost control of their lives and often, their home environment as well. The findings suggest that many of the participants experience physical abuse, verbal abuse, depression, failing health and social isolation.    Recommendations: A case management strategy, inclusive of risk management processes, is suggested as one means of supporting this vulnerable group of carers.
