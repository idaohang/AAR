This study aimed to identify the prevalence and types of complementary and alternativemedications (CAMs) used by women during menopause and explore potential associationsbetween CAM use and menopausal symptoms. Analysis was undertaken with 886 randomlyselected menopausal women aged 47â€“67 years who participated in a postal questionnaire onthe menopause experience. The prevalence of CAM use was relatively high (82.5%), withnutrition most commonly cited (67%), followed by phytoestrogens (56%), herbal therapies(41%), and CAM medications (25%). Multivariate analysis adjusted for confounders revealedthat women who consumed CAM medications were 17â€“23% more likely to report anxiety(p  .019) or vasomotor symptoms (p  .013). Women who used herbal therapies (p  .009) orphytoestrogens (p  .030) were 13â€“16% more likely to experience vasomotor symptoms.Women who used nutrition were 18% more likely to experience anxiety (p  .049). Theseresults highlight the importance for health professionals to incorporate CAMs into theirpractice to better inform menopausal women of their treatment choices.
