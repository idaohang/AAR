This paper challenges the hegemony (the mindset prevailing within education and health-care environments) that produces and maintains the problems associated with nurses using research evidence in their practise. The challenge is organized around the construct of change. The envisaged changes concern what nurses think and do in relation to nursing research. The position held in the present paper is that the use of research evidence by nurses in their practise will remain a challenge until changes occur to the ways that nurses understand, value and initiate research. It is argued that changing the ways that nurses understand, value and initiate research requires an ideological shift: a re-education from one set of beliefs, perceptions, values and practises to another. The paper concludes with some suggestions for transforming the hegemonic influences of nurse education systems and the health-care organizations in which nurses work.
