Previous investigations of the mechanical properties of the cornea have dealt with post mortem material which has been reported as having a delayed as well as an instantaneous component in its response to deforming forces. In the present investigation the recovery of the human in vivo cornea after deformation was measured by a photokeratoscope method. the delayed component of the recovery was much smaller than expected on the basis of some published results for the post mortem material.
