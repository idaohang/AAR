The field of aberrations of the human eye is moving rapidly, being driven by the desire to monitor and optimise vision following refractive surgery. In this paper, I discuss the different ways of representing aberrations of the human eye, the terminology used, how wave aberrations are used to determine refractions, the influence of pupil size on aberrations, how to compare right and left eye aberrations, how aberrations can be manipulated into different forms, how to make corrections for changes in wavelength, the appropriate ocular axis, and corneal and lenticular components of the aberrations.
