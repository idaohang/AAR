Rural health and government bodies have identified the need for greater numbers of health professionals in rural and remote health care settings. Providing students with the opportunity to experience a rural clinical placement has been suggested as one strategy for future health professionals to gain familiarity with the rural workplace and an awareness of the employment opportunities available in these areas. Although substantial numbers of student nurses have participated in a rural undergraduate clinical placement program at Queensland University of Technology since 1996, available places remain unfilled. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing student nurses in their choice of a rural or metropolitan clinical placement.    This study utilised a descriptive survey design to collect pre-test data. The study was part of a larger project using a quasi-experimental pre-post test design. All final year Bachelor of Nursing students who were included in the sample subsequently undertook a clinical placement at a metropolitan or a rural clinical venue, with a 65% response rate for the pre-test (n = 137), and a 57% response rate post-test (n = 121). Findings demonstrated that possession of a rural background, previous work experience in a rural community and family, financial and/or employment commitments all influenced studentsâ€™ choice of undertaking a rural clinical placement.
