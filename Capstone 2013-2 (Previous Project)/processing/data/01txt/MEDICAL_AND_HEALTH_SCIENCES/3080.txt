Previous studies have suggested that central corneal oedema during hydrogel lens wear can be reduced by placing peripheral fenestrations in the lens. In this study, optical pachometry was used to monitor central and peripheral corneal swelling in response to a peripherally fenestrated hydrogel lens. The experiment was conducted in a double-masked, randomised manner on 10 unadapted subjects. Fenestrations did not alter central corneal oedema, but peripheral corneal oedema was reduced by 34% (p &lt; 0.001). Fenestrations may therefore provide a useful strategy for minimising lens-induced corneal oedema. Clinical trials with fenestrated lenses are now indicated.
