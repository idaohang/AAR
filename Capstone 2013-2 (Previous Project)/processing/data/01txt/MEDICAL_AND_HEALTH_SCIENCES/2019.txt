The World Health Organization provides detailed mortality data files through the WHO Mortality Database (WHO MDB). While valuable information is available from the WHO MDB, there are some inherent difficulties in the utilisation of such data for the user. Through describing the procedures for downloading and formatting the data, and the utilisation of the available data, the author aims to promote the MDB for wider application by mortality researchers.
