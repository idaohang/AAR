Research in palliative care is notoriously difficult. The formation of research networks may be one way to facilitate research in this difficult area. In order to map current research activity and to gauge interest in the formation of a research network, a questionnaire was sent to all palliative care providers in Queensland, Australia. The majority of respondents (63%) had had no prior experience in research in palliative care. The most common barriers to research were a lack of time, support, funds, and experienced personnel. Sixty percent of respondents voiced an enthusiasm for starting a network resulting in the formation of the Queensland Palliative Care Research Group. The key objectives of the group are to promote research throughout the state and to provide a forum for collaboration, exchange of ideas and the sharing of research experience.
