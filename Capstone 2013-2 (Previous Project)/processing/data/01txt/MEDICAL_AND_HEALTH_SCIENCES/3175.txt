A new type of probe devised for the Goldmann applanation tonometer depends for its operation on the difference in critical angles for glass-tear fluid and glass-cornea interfaces. The probe failed to work correctly, and subsequent investigations to determine why were directed at the physical structure of the pre-corneal tear film. Photometry indicated that the anterior surface of the cornea in vivo reflected up to 8% of the incident light, more then seems generally supposed. Calculations of the anterior corneal surface reflectance indicate that two or three layer models of the pre-corneal tear film fit the observations. Slit lamp observations indicated that the reflectance of the corneal epithelium is much lower than that of the endothelium.
