This study compared the efficacy of two protocols for oral care using either chlorhexidine or benzydamine as oral rinses to alleviate mucositis in children undergoing chemotherapy. Eligible participants were randomised to receive either protocol for 3 weeks in a two-period crossover design. The occurrence of ulcerative lesions and severity of mucositis were measured at baseline and twice weekly, using the modified Oral Assessment Guide (OAG). Data were continuously analysed by plotting them directly on predefined sequential charts. According to this sequential analysis, the study could be terminated at the 34th within subject comparison, with a statistically significant reduction in ulcerative lesions (P&lt;0.05) and severity of mucositis (P&lt;0.05) in children on the chlorhexidine protocol. These findings suggest that chlorhexidine together with oral care might be helpful in alleviating mucositis when given prophylactically to children on chemotherapy, but the therapeutic benefit needs to be confirmed in a larger trial.
