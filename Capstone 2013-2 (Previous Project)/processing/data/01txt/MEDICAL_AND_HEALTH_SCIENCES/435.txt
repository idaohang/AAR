Coronary angioplasty and stent placement procedures now represent one of the fastest growing specialties in cardiac care; patients undergo a short stay admission with limited care time with nurses. The purpose of this study was to describe participantsâ€™ experiences of preparing for angioplasty in such an environment. Eight men and three women were interviewed 1 month after discharge from hospital. Verbatim transcripts were analysed for major themes using the qualitative techniques of grounded theory.    Participants described working through a problem solving process in response to the perceived health threat associated with undergoing angioplasty. In step one, the problem was identified. In step two, coping responses were taken to try and solve the problem. In step three, the results of the coping responses were appraised or evaluated. The two problems identified were ongoing chest pain and anxiety related to fear of the unknown. The coping responses initiated included acquiring knowledge of the angioplasty, confidence in the skill of the doctor, support from family and gearing up psychologically. In the final appraisal of the coping responses, the participants decided to either go ahead with, or delay the angioplasty procedure.  The results of this study indicate that the preparation for angioplasty represents a period of adjustment that may be anxiety provoking.  Participantsâ€™ experiences provide new knowledge of the concerns and challenges faced when undergoing such an invasive procedure in a short stay environment. The results clearly highlight that psychosocial aspects of nursing care are an essential component of nursing practice for angioplasty patients.
