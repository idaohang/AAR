Venous leg ulcers are a frequent source of chronic ill-health and a considerable cost to health-care systems. This paper reports pilot study results from a randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a community-based â€˜Leg Clubâ€™ environment on improving healing rates of venous leg ulcers. Leg Clubs offer a setting where people with similar problems can socialize in a supportive, information-sharing environment. A sample of 33 clients with a below-knee venous leg ulcer were randomized to treatment, either in their own homes or in a community Leg Club. Treatment was provided to all participants, whether in the control group or intervention group, by a team of trained wound-care nurses following evidence-based assessment and treatment guidelines. Data were collected on admission to the study and at 12 weeks from admission. Results showed a significant improvement in healing in the intervention group compared to the control group, as measured by ulcer area size and Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing scores. These results suggest that a community Leg Club environment provides benefits additional to wound care expertise and evidence-based care. Knowledge gained from this study provides evidence to guide service delivery and improve client outcomes.
