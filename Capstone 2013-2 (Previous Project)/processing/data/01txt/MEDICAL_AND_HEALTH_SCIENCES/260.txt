The purpose of this study was to examine family carersâ€™ knowledge, skills and attitudes in caring for older people following the implementation of a Family Carersâ€™ Training Program (FCTP). Family carers (n=240) from two villages in Indonesia were randomly selected. All participants were surveyed by questionnaires and their care behaviour observed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Findings indicated significant increases in knowledge, skills and attitudes in the intervention group over six months compared to those of the control group. Hence, the FCTP demonstrated a positive effect on family carersâ€™ capabilities and attitudes in caring for older people living in the community in the study setting.
