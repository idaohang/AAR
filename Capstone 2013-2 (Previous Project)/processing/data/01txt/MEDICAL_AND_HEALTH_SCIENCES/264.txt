Background.   The ideal duration of intravascular administration set use is unknown. Studies have compared the infective implications of one to seven days of use. The Centers for Disease Control recommend at least three days usage. No previous study has evaluated the accuracy of volume delivery or integrity of administration sets after prolonged use.    Aim. To evaluate the accuracy and condition of intravascular administration sets used continuously for 7 days.    Design. Prospective, randomised, experimental study in the laboratory setting.    Methods. Four administration sets were randomly assigned to deliver 2 mL/h (IMED syringe set 2280-0000), 20, 50 or 100 mL/h (IMED infusion sets 2210-0500) of crystalloid solution continuously for 7 days through an IMED Geminiïƒ’ four channel infusion pump (PC4).  At study commencement and daily for 7 days, a 4 hour volume measurement and an inspection for leaks/erosion of administration sets occurred for each administration set (total measurements = 32).    Results. Mean volume outputs over four hours were 7.84mL (2mL/h), 80.66 mL (20mL/h), 205.35 (50 mL/h) and 406.37 (100 mL/h). These differed significantly from the programmed volumes (p = 0.00 â€“ 0.01). Usage duration did not influence performance (F = 0.866, p = 0.55). Accuracy of volume delivery differed significantly with pump speed (F = 106.933, p &lt; 0.001) exhibiting increased volume to 50 mL/h then a reduction at 100 mL/h. Differences were within manufacturer specifications (+/- 5%) and were clinically acceptable. All administration sets remained in appropriate condition displaying no leakage or erosion.    Conclusion. There were small inaccuracies found between programmed and delivered volumes however there was no deterioration in performance over time. This suggests that inaccuracies were due to normal pump performance rather than the administration sets. Administration sets retain acceptable accuracy and condition after 7 days continuous use. Further research should assess the infective and other impacts of prolonged usage.
