Abstract only    Reaction times were measured in a complex three distance task for presbyopic subjects wearing multifocal spectacle corrections or bifocal contact lens corrections; the same taks was performed by young control subjects with no correction and further groups of young control subjects wearing hard or soft contact lenses. The targets could be discriminated only if subjects were looking directly at the displays. The reaction times were at least for targets presented at the intermediate distance, and increased for near and distance targets. Subjects wearing spectacle corrections gave better performance on the whole than those wearing the contact lens corrections, but there were no significant differences in reaction times between the two spectacle corrections used or between the six contact lens corrections used. Neither of the presbyopic groups performed as well as the young control group.
