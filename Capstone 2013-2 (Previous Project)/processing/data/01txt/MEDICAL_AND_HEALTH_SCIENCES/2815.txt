Worldwide evidence pinpoints the importance of effective early care and education services. Initiatives such as Head Start (United States) and Sure Start (United Kingdom) suggest that access to, awareness and responsiveness of community services are enhanced when services are integrated. We propose that service integration can also contribute to social capital and sense of community.  This paper reports on research by a partnership of government and non-government agencies into the impact of Child Care and Family Support Hubs in Queensland, Australia. These community-driven hubs are a recent state government initiative designed to improve and integrate service provision, particularly in rural and disadvantaged communities. The paper reports on findings from the pilot work, the ACCESS Study (2000-2001), as well the ongoing three-year Queensland Hubs Study.
