The effect of changes in rigid contact lens overall and optic zone diameters on tear pump efficiency were studied using a polarographic technique. Six overall diameters ranged from 7.6 to 10.6 mm in 0.6-mm steps, with the optic zone diameter always being 1.4 mm smaller. Base curve radii were made flatter as lens overall/optic zone diameters increased in order to maintain a constant tear layer thickness. All other parameters were held constant. Oxygen uptake rates were measured for the normal, open eye, as well as after 5 min of static (without blinking) and dynamic (with blinking once every 5 s) wear of each lens design. Under both static and dynamic conditions, oxygen uptake rates increased with increase in lens overall/optic zone diameter. The differences between the static and dynamic condition data served as an index of tear pump efficiency for each lens. These differences decreased with increase in lens overall/optic zone diameter.
