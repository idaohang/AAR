Aim: To compare the rate of humidifier-acquired pneumonia between patients in whom circuitry is changed every three days (current practice) with patients in whom circuitry is changed every 7 days.  Background: Published guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia state that ventilator circuitry should be changed no more frequently than every 48 hours, there are no recommendations for the optimal length of time humidified oxygen circuits should be used.   Design: Prospective randomised controlled trial.  Methods: Patients receiving humidified oxygen in surgical, medical and infectious diseases units in a 942 bed general teaching hospital in Queensland, Australia were eligible. Those consenting were randomly allocated to either 3-day (control) or 7-day (intervention) circuit changes. The primary outcome measure was rate of nosocomial pneumonia.   Results: Of the 51 eligible patients, 32 were included in the study (17 patients were randomized to the control group and 15 patients to the intervention group; recruitment rate 63%).  During the study, four cases of nosocomial pneumonia occurred; two in the intervention group (13.3%) and two in the control group (11.8%)(Ï‡21 = 0.018, p = 0.894). No patients died during the study period .    Conclusion: Conducting a large-scale randomised controlled trial in this area would be feasible.  Relevance to clinical practice: This study is a first attempt to provide evidence on which to base practice guidelines for the management of humidified oxygen in a hospital setting.
