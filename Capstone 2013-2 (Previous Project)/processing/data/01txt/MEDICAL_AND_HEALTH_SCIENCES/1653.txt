Most patients with low vision request help with reading. Despite improvements in the  assessment of visual functions, determining the appropriate magnification for reading  still often involves a trial and error approach. Recent research has shown that with  accurate and systematic assessments of vision, the required magnification can be  predicted but this magnification needs to be much higher than has been previously  recommended. This paper presents a systematic approach to enable practitioners to  determine the power of a near addition or simple magnifier needed to assist patients  with mild or moderate low vision who may present seeking help for reading. Guidelines  for appropriate referral to low vision services are also provided.
