A more universal approach to the understanding of menopause can offer health professionals a broader view of the phenomenon. This studyâ€™s objectives were to describe and explain the menopausal experiences of Asian and Occidental women, and to examine the relationship between social/cultural factors and womenâ€™s menopausal symptoms.    Questionnaires were used to investigate psychosocial and cultural factors and menopausal symptoms in 45 to 55 year old Taiwanese (n = 105) and Australian women (n = 450). Variables included: social demography; menopausal status; attitudes toward menopause; mental health; vitality; social functioning and menopausal symptoms.    Significant differences were found between Taiwanese and Australian women in attitude towards menopause, menopausal symptoms and vitality scores. No significant differences were seen in the areas of social functioning, mental health and menopause status. The results suggest that cultural factors may influence the experience of menopause for women. These findings may help health professionalsâ€™ understanding of cultural beliefs relating to menopause and to provide culturally appropriate care.
