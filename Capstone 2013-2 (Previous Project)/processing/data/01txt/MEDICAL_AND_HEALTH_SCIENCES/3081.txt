A newly developed instrument for the measurement of flexible contact lens parameters incorporating an autostigmatic microscope and optimised light collection techniques, is evaluated. The instrument measures back and front central optic radii and centre thickness of the contact lens, and these measurements can be used to determine back vertex powers. The instrument is shown to provide reliable and repeatable measures of lens parameters.
