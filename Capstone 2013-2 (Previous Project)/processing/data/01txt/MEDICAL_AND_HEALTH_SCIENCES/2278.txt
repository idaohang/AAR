Background	  The primary focus of studies on preferences regarding the disclosure of Alzheimerâ€™s disease diagnoses has been the preferences of AD-carers.  Relatively few studies have investigated such preferences in other groups, nor have the reasons behind such preferences been widely or systematically investigated.     Objectives	  To provide some preliminary data on AD-disclosure preferences among non-carer older adults and to compare this data to that of AD-carers; to investigate reasons underlying disclosure preference among carers and non AD-carers, and; to explore the level of AD knowledge among carer and non-carer samples and investigate its relationship with disclosure preferences.    Methods 	  Participants were 20 elderly adults who were not caring for a relative with AD, and 16 older adults who were caring for an AD relative.  Participants completed a modified AD knowledge test and a test designed to measure the reasons for and against disclosure of an AD diagnosis.      Results		  AD knowledge among AD carers was significantly higher than among non-carers.  Views about disclosure of AD diagnoses did not differ between groups though generally opinions were pro-disclosure (at least 85% of the overall sample opted for disclosure).  No significant differences were found when preferences for disclosure for oneself versus a significant other were compared.  Similar reasons for disclosure were given by carers and non-carers, and included factors such as the personsâ€™ right to know their diagnosis.    Conclusions	  Older Australians overwhelmingly supported disclosure of AD diagnoses, whether or not they had previously been through the diagnostic process.
