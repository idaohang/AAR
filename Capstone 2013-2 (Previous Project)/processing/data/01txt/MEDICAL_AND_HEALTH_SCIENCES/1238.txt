Nursing students experience increasing levels of stress throughout their   baccalaureate programme (Deary et al., 2003) and upon graduation face   enormous challenges of settling into the clinical environment and managing   clients with complex health problems. A graduate transition scheme (GTS)   was designed to better prepare students graduating from a 4-year bachelor of   nursing degree programme for their transition to Registered Nurses (RNs) and   integration into the health care team to provide quality care to the clients.
