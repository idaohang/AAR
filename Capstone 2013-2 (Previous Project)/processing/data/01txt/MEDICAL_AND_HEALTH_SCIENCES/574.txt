Between 1997 and 2002, two major changes occurred in the classification of causes of death and mortality coding practices in Australia. In 1997, automated coding software (ACS) was introduced to Australia for mortality coding; and in 1999, Australia introduced the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) for the coding of causes of death. These changes had significant implications for the classification of cause of death information and the consistency of mortality data in Australia. This information paper aims to illustrate the impact of these changes on mortality trends, and to highlight the diseases most affected by the changes.
