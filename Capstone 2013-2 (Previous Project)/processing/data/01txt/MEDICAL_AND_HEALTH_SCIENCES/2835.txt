High-speed videokeratoscopy is an emerging technology that has the potential to provide  new information on dynamic changes of corneal topography and tear film behaviour. We have developed a high-speed videokeratoscope that has the ability to acquire data at the rate of 50 Hz. Two major applications of the technology are considered in this paper. First, the analysis of tear film stability in the inter-blink interval is evaluated and techniques for estimating the tear film build- up and break-up times are considered. The second application involves the study of the dynamic response of the corneal anterior surface to mechanical forces exerted by the eyelids during horizontal eye movements in downward gaze. The limitations and potential opportunities for the use of this new technology are discussed.
