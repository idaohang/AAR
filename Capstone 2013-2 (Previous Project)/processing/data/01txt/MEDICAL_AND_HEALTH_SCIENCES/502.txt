Paediatric nurses manage fevers in hospitalised children daily, a complex practice. This study identified varied decision making criteria and inconsistent practice influenced by many external variables. Nurses perform a comprehensive assessment to make an informed decision. However, factors influencing their practice include medical orders, the childâ€™s temperament, a history of febrile convulsions, parental requests, colleagues and ward norms. Nurses have a â€˜temperatureâ€™ at which they consider a child febrile (37.0C to 39.0C) and many reported a â€˜temperatureâ€™ at which they administered antipyretics (37.5C to 39.0C). Antipyretics were administered to febrile children for pain relief, irritability, at parentsâ€™ request and to settle a child for the night. Administration was reported to be higher during the day and evening shifts, at medication rounds and when the ward is busy. At night, nurses are reluctant to waken a sleeping febrile child, preferring to observe them. Recommendations to promote consistent fever management practices are included.
