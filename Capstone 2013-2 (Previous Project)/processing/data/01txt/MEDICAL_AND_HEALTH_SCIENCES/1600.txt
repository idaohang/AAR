The aim of the study was to identify from people with MS and their families, what information, in what format and when in the course of the disease they felt would assist the newly diagnosed person with MS and their family. A state wide cross sectional self-report study design was utilised for this research project. Thirty-four people with MS and 18 family members participated in the research proper. Participants self selected.  The people with MS and family and friends who participated in this research wish to be provided with a range of information. They recommended that the newly diagnosed and their families be provided with information that reflects their personal needs, be provided in person in both group and individual sessions and include research aimed at cures and therapies, counselling and support services early in the course of the disease.
