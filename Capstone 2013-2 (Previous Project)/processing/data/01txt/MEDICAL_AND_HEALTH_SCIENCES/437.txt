Coronary angioplasty and stent placement is associated with short hospital stays. Patients are expected to recover at home, alone, following limited care time with nurses. The purpose of the study was to describe participantsâ€™ perceptions of recovery after angioplasty. Eight men and three women were interviewed 1 month after discharge from hospital. Verbatim transcripts were analysed for major themes using the qualitative techniques of grounded theory. Data analysis revealed three major categories: awareness of the problem, coping response and appraisal of the situation. These were linked via a problem solving process. In step one, the problem was identified. In step two, coping responses were taken to try and solve the problem. In step three, the results of the coping responses were appraised or evaluated. These categories were further defined by four phases identified as: pre-admission, admission, during the angioplasty and recovery. This paper describes the recovery phase. Awareness of the problem in the recovery phase was associated with â€˜relief from chest painâ€™ for most participants. In contrast, anxiety continued and was associated with â€˜uncertainty over future healthâ€™. Participants described coping responses of â€œtaking control of their life againâ€¿ by undertaking both physical and psychological strategies. Finally, the situation was appraised to be either a â€˜goodâ€™ or a â€˜badâ€™ recovery. This appraisal was based on such considerations as the absence of chest pain, improvement in well-being and energy levels. The results of this study highlight patientsâ€™ concerns and support the need for greater emphasis on their psychosocial needs. This care must be provided within the time constraints of short hospital stays. Nurses must also consider providing support to patients in the pre-admission and recovery phases.
