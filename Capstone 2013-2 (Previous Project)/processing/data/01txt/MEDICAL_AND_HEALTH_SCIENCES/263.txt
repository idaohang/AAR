The need for critical thinking in nursing has been accentuated in response to the rapidly changing health care environment. Nurses must think critically to provide effective care whilst coping with the expansion in role associated with the complexities of current health care systems. This literature review will present a history of inquiry into critical thinking and research to support the conclusion that critical thinking is necessary not only in the clinical practice setting, but also as an integral component of nursing education programs to promote the development of nursesâ€™ critical thinking abilities. The aims of this paper are: (a) to review the literature on critical thinking, (b) to examine the dimensions of critical thinking, (c) to investigate the various critical thinking strategies for their appropriateness to enhance critical thinking in nurses and (d) to examine issues relating to evaluation of critical thinking skills in nursing.
