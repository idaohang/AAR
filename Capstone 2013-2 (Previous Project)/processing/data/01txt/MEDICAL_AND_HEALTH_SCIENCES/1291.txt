This paper contends that dysfunctional patterns of communication can develop in family aged care dyads in response to stereotypical role expectations in the caregiving-carereceiving relationship, thus giving rise to a role predicament of caring. If this argument holds it follows that more productive and effective forms of communication and relationship are dependent upon both members of the aged care dyad understanding the expectations of their role and if necessary reconstructing them. Part 1 of this two part conceptual paper develops the Communication Predicament of Ageing Model to include role expectations. The conceptions are grounded in important conclusions drawn from data contained in a large comprehensive study of older people and their family caregivers. Part 2 of the paper (to be published in the next issue of Quality in Ageing) introduces the health promoting communication model which was developed as a framework for guiding both prevention and intervention strategies to prevent or transform a role predicament of caring.
