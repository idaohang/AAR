The main aim of the present study was to explore the midlife experience for women living in Australia and Japan. The specific objectives of the study included: (i) comparing menopausal symptoms between the two groups; and (ii) comparing the factor structure of symptoms and exploring their relationship to menopausal status. Postal questionnaires were distributed to two structured, random population based samples of midlife women aged 45â€“60 years; consisting of 712 women living in Australia and 1502 women living in Japan. Analysis showed significant differences in menopausal symptoms related to psychological symptoms (P&lt;0.001), including anxiety (P&lt;0.001) and depression (P&lt; 0.001), somatic symptoms (P&lt;0.001), and vasomotor symptoms (P&lt;0.01). The analysis,which excluded hormone replacement therapy (HRT) users, found that there were significant differences seen across menopausal status in the following symptoms: difficulty in sleeping (P&lt;0.01), difficulty in concentrating (P&lt;0.01), feeling dizzy or faint (P&lt;0.001), loss of interest in most things (P&lt;0.01) and loss of feeling in hands or feet (P&lt;0.001). In the postmenopausal stage specifically, significant differences were seen in the areas of feeling tense or nervous (P&lt;0.01), feeling unhappy or depressed (P&lt;0.01), parts of body feeling numb or tingling (P&lt;0.05), headaches (P&lt;0.01), and sweating at night (P&lt;0.05). Our analysis revealed that the experience of menopause for women is different between Australian and Japanese women.
