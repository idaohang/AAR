The ability of the binocular system to suppress blur from the defocused eye is an important mechanism underlying the success of monovision correction. With a group of 60 new monovision wearers, we found that blur suppression ability varied substantially between subjects and that crossed dominance influenced blur suppression ability. Symptoms of ghosting amongst the monovision wearers appeared to be influenced by the strength of rivalry dominance. An understanding of the suppression processes underlying monovision may assist in patient selection and management.
