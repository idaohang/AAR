Tensile and four point bending tests were used to assess the material properties of the short glass fibre reinforced (SGFR) epoxy resin that are used as the cortical analogue in third generation Sawbones, at both room (22 degrees Celsius) and body temperatures (37 degrees Celsius).     This research demonstrates that the modulus of elasticity of SGFR epoxy used in third generation Sawbones is highly temperature dependent. A reduction in modulus of elasticity of up to 63 percent was observed when increasing the temperature of the specimens from room to body temperature. When performing in vitro total hip modelling ideally the specimens should be at 37Â°C due to the properties of PMMA cement, however SGFR epoxy Sawbones do not accurately represent bone at this temperature. Hence, this material is not an appropriate model for testing the mechanics of implants that use bone cement.
