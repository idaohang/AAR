High-speed videokeratoscopy (HSV) is an emerging technology that has the potential to acquire information on the dynamics of corneal topography and tear-film behavior. We show that the surface regularity and asymmetry indices, which are traditionally used for characterizing the stability of precorneal tear film, have limitations in the context of HSV because they are highly sensitive to natural ocular microfluctuations. To overcome this problem, we propose a new microfluctuation-independent surface indicator. It is based on the root-mean-square of the error of the parametric model fit to the surface. Further, we develop techniques for estimating the tear film build-up and break-up times. The tear film build-up time estimator is based on the proposed RMS fit surface indicator while the tear film break-up time estimator is derived directly from a set of consecutive HSV digital images, without the need for estimating the resulting corneal surface.
