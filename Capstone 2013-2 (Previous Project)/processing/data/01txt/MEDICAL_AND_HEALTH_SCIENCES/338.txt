Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (IABC) is an established treatment for the support of a failing heart.  In the setting of cardiac failure, incidence of IABC utilisation can be grouped into five categories: post bypass; cardiogenic shock; acute myocardial infarction (MI) and MI extension; elective; and miscellaneous. The aim of this study was to compare published American and European insertion indications and mortality, with those experienced at a major Australian cardiothoracic tertiary referral hospital.
