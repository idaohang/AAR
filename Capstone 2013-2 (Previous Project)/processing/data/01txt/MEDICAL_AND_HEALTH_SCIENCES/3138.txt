PURPOSE: Center of gravity and lens mass have both been shown to influence rigid lens centration and stability. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative contributions of these two factors to rigid lens dynamics. METHODS: Eight subjects (four with high-riding lenses and four with low-riding lenses) participated in the study. Each subject was fit with 12 lenses-six designs in each of two materials. Center of gravity and lens mass were recorded in every case. For each lens, four lens dynamics variables were assessed over a five-blink cycle for both the vertical and the horizontal meridians: 1) initial lens position; 2) settled lens position; 3) amount of lens movement; and 4) rate of lens movement. RESULTS: Multiple regression and correlation analysis showed that center of gravity influences initial and settled lens position, in both the horizontal and the vertical meridians. Mass alone was found not to be a significant predictor of rigid lens dynamics. The effect of center of gravity on settled vertical lens position was only apparent when high rider and low rider subgroups were analyzed separately, with a posterior movement of the center of gravity being associated with a lowering of the settled lens position for high rider subjects, and a raising of the settled lens position for low rider subjects. The results suggest that a rigid lens will become more stable as the center of gravity is shifted further behind the lens vertex, but this effect is reduced as lens mass is increased. CONCLUSIONS: The location of the center of gravity of a rigid lens influences its on-eye centration and stability more so than does lens mass.
