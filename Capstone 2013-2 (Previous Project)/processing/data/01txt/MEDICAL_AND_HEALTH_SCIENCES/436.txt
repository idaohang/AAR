Self-regulated learning enables learners to transform their cognitive abilities into actions for task-related academic challenges. It involves the student in the development of personal initiative, perseverance and adaptation in the pursuit of learning.      Wellness is a complex multiple layered concept that requires students to be introspective through deep critical thinking. Intrinsic to teaching the Wellness concept is the belief that â€˜in order to prepare students for a professional life they must be prepared for Lifeâ€™.  There is a need to provide learning scaffolds which are supports or suggestions rather than step-by-step instructions. Students who are mostly new to university study must learn to adopt a deep approach to thinking and learning about this concept in order for the experience to be enriching in both a personal and academic manner.      The advent of reduced funds, larger classes and emerging student worklife issues has shifted the teaching paradigm. The teaching approach in a large first year class utilises social forms of learning to assist students in becoming self-regulated in their approaches to personal Wellness. Through the processes of informing, assessing, role modeling, coaching by peers, mentors and teachers, students become engaged in learning which is personally meaningful. This case study illustrates how aims and objectives for the unit have been aligned through its pedagogical components including content, support, assessment, learning environments &amp; learning activities to the desired learning outcomes. There is a tension between aligned approaches to curriculum design and the practicalities of teaching large classes. This raises critical issues for further consideration.
