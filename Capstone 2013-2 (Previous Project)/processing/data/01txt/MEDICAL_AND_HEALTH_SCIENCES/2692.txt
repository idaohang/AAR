For displaced subcapital fractures of the femoral neck, the uncemented Austin Moore is the most frequently used monoblock hemiarthroplasty in Australia. Commonly this procedure is reserved for the elderly or frail low demand patient, who represents a poor candidate for revision should the prosthesis fail. Technical errors in implantation of the uncemented Austin Moore are common, and have been associated with early failure of the prosthesis. This study aims to assess the technical accuracy of implantation of the uncemented Austin Moore prosthesis, with specific reference to Orthopaedic Registrars.
