Fracture healing is retarded in the presence of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, demonstrating an important role of COX-2 in trauma-induced woven bone adaptation. The aim of this experiment was to determine the influence of COX-2 inhibition on the remodeling and consolidation of non-traumatic woven bone produced by mechanical loading. A periosteal woven bone callus was initiated in the right tibia of female Wistar rats following a single bout of four-point-bending, applied as a haversine wave for 300 cycles at a frequency of 2Hz and a magnitude of 65N. Daily injections of Vehicle (VEH: polyethyleneglycol) or the COX-2 inhibitor, DFU (2.0 mg.kg-1 and 0.02mg.kg-1 i.p.), commenced 7 days postloading, and tibiae were examined 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks postloading. Tibiae were dissected, embedded in polymethylmethacrylate and sectioned for histomorphometric analysis of periosteal woven bone. No significant difference in peak woven bone area was observed between DFU-treated and VEH rats. But treatment with DFU resulted in a temporal defect in woven bone formation, where the achievement of peak woven bone area was delayed by one week. Woven bone remodeling was observed in DFU-treated rats at 21 days post-loading, demonstrating that remodeling of the periosteal callus is not prevented in the presence of a COX-2 inhibitor in the rat. We conclude that COX-2 inhibition does not significantly disrupt the mechanism of woven bone remodeling, but alters its timing.
