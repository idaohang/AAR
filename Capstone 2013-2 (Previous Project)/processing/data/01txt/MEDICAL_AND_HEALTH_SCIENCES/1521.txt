The International Partnership in Self-management and Empowerment (IPSE) is a collaborative group of researchers who are investigating the role of self-efficacy in the management of chronic disease. One aim of IPSE is to produce reliable and valid theory-based instruments that can be used to measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve self-efficacy.  To date, two instruments have been developed for use with people who are self-managing Type 2 diabetes. These are the Diabetes Mellitus Self-Efficacy Scale (DMSES) and the Perceived Therapeutic Efficacy Scale (PTES). The DMSES and PTES have been translated into several languages, and are now being psychometrically tested with diabetes populations in Australia, Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, UK and the USA. This paper will discuss the Australian study and present preliminary evidence on the reliability and validity of the English/Australian versions of the DMSES and PTES.
