According to the five year blueprint for Nursing Education in Queensland (Board of Nursing Studies, 1993) midwifery is to be moved into the tertiary sector. In 1994 Queensland University of Technology became the second Queensland university to initiate a tertiary-based midwifery program.  As part of the approach to teaching a clinical log was  developed, with a specific focus on the clinical practice aspect of the students learning, while recognising that clinical practice and theory are interwoven in reality.  It was intended to be a portable, easily understood adjunct to the learning of student midwives in a new Graduate Diploma in Nursing (midwifery) course.
