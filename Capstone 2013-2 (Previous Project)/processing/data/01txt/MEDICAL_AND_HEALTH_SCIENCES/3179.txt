Trials were conducted in which subjects wore various contact lenses while their corneas were exposed to gases of varying oxygen content. Measurements of central and peripheral corneal thickness and corneal topography show that corneal topography changes after contact lens wear can have at least two causes, an unevenly distributed corneal thickness change and/or a mechanical molding of the shape.
