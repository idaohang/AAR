Palliative care nursing practice is undertaken by both specialist and generalist nurses in the community setting. Yet the education of generalist nurses has received limited attention in the literature. St Lukeâ€™s Nursing Service (SLNS) developed a palliative care education programme entitled Palliative Care: a Community Nursing Approach (PCACNA) with the aim of improving palliative care practice of nurses working in community settings. This programme utilised a number of learning strategies and was delivered by flexible modes. To evaluate the programme and identify areas for future development, a survey was undertaken of nurses who participated in the programme from May 1999 to July 2001. A response rate of 48% was obtained. Analysis of responses to survey questions assessing participantsâ€™ perceptions of learning strategies employed and learning outcomes achieved identified three core themes relating to: specific learning outcomes; personal and professional development; and the value of particular learning strategies. Participantsâ€™ responses particularly emphasised the relevance to generalist nurses of a practice-based learning approach in the provision of palliative care education.     In this non-refereed practice article, a team of nurses working with the SLNS in Queensland, discuss the successful implementation of a palliative care education programme. The work is an example of how nurses are putting theory into practice through the creation of innovative programmes. The publication of practical applications, such as that at St Luke's, is consistent with the AJCN aim to encourage nurses across settings to share their practice experiences and learn from each other. The editors anticipate that regular practice applications can be featured in future issues of the AJCN.
