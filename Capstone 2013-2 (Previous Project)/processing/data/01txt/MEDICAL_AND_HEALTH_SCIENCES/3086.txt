Near vision problems with flexible contact lens wear are often sited as a cause for patient failure. This near vision blur is shown to be primarily caused by distortion of the anterior contact lens surface during near fixation. Contact lens surface changes due to an increased inter-blink period during near vision may contribute to the near difficulty.
