A project is descibed in which changes in various corneal parameters during contact lens wear were measured while variables effecting these changes wre either controlled or their effect observed. Increases in central corneal thickness and thickness at four points in the corneal periphery are described. As well, the recovery of the corneal thickness change two hours after lens removal is described.
