Abstract  This retrospective study examines the military employment of soldiers in the Australian Regular Army 3 years after Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Patients undertaking ACL reconstruction were more likely to be assessed as medically unfit for military service compared to ACL patent controls, however overall discharge rates were not affected. 71% of patients were considered fit for military service 3 years after ACL reconstruction, allowing their participation in active operational duty.
