Single vision aspheric contact lens designs may be able to enhance visual performance by controlling spherical aberration. In this study, we have compared the visual performance provided by two front surface aspheric rigid contact lenses with that of a spherical rigid contact lens and spectacle correction. These 4 corrections were worn by ten subjects while visual acuity was determined as a function of aperture size. The possibility that front surface aspheric lens designs may enhance visual performance was confirmed, although individual subjects varied significantly in this visual response. Contributions to the visual performance, other than contact lens surface shape, may include lens position and stability.
