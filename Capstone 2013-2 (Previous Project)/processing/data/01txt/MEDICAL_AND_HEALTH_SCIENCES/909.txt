To determine if radiation can infiltrate into welding helmets, a UV detector was placed in the eye socket of a headform which was then fitted with a range of welding helmets. The headform was exposed to a collimated beam of UV radiation from varioud orientations and the amount of infiltration determined. Radiation was found to be reflected off the filter plate and into the detector (eye) after entering though: (1) an opening between the edge of the shield and the side of the face, and (2)an opening between the top lip of the shield and the top of the head. Design features such as a cut-away in top lip of the shield and filter plate of larger surface area contributed to more radiation, from a grater range of angles reaching the eye the results have significance for welding performed in highly reflective and closed situations such as inside metal tanks.
