There are no reported education programs specifically focusing on the needs of rural health workers in the area of violence against women. The most commonly reported contact sought by women experiencing injuries and health problems associated with violence and abuse is with health workers. Women report a failure by health workers to make direct enquires, which may be due to their lack of education and confidence in responding to these issues. A convenience sample of 60 community-based rural health workers from a range of occupations and settings within the Wide Bay Health Region, Queensland, participated in the evaluation of a self-paced, distance education package on violence against women. The package contained seven modules. These included written and audio tape material, and activities that together formed a community development approach to addressing the needs in the participants' local community. Participants were given a mentor and teleconference support during the 8 weeks allocated to complete the package. A pre- and post-course evaluation, containing quantitative and qualitative data, was completed. Analysis of the quantitative data identified significant changes in participants' knowledge, and the qualitative data highlighted an increased sense of confidence in assisting women, forming support networks and using resources more effectively. Participants reported the most useful aspects of the package were: (i) modular- and user-friendly format; (ii) flexible, practical, health-focused content; and (iii) real world examples.
