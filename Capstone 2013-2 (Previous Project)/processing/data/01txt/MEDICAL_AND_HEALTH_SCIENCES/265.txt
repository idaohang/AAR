This research provides a profile of nurse executivesâ€™ roles, career opportunities and professional development needs across metropolitan, provincial, rural and remote settings in Queensland. A cross-sectional survey was posted to all Directors / Assistant Directors of Nursing in the Queensland Public Health Sector (n = 281), with a response rate of 52.3% (n=147).     Findings indicated that nursing executivesâ€™ roles have expanded and diversified, with multiple role responsibilities increasing with distance from the metropolitan area. Nurse executives in remote areas were less satisfied with the quality of supervision and mentorship they received, and least likely to participate in career enhancing activities. Metropolitan nursing executives utilised more of the career enhancing opportunities provided by the Queensland Public Sector than provincial, rural or remote nursing executives. Provincial nurse executives were the group most likely to network, attend conferences and participate in informal educational activities. Professional development needs, although generally common to all groups, were more practice specific for those in rural and remote areas. Many nurse executives begin their careers in rural or remote areas where limited opportunities for career development may be detrimental to their future development.
