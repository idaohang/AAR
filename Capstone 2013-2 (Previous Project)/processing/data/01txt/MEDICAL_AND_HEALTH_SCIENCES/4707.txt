The early identification and referral of students with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is crucial for the implementation of timely intervention and therapy. Classroom teachers could be well positioned to identify and refer students with OCD to the school counsellor or support services team due to their extensive interaction with these students. However, teachers need to become more knowledgeable about OCD to successfully identify and thus be able to refer students with OCD (Purcell, 1999). These students also need to be managed differently within the classroom. However, there is limited support to guide teacher practice in this area. This paper provides a general overview of childhood OCD and explores the role of teachers in the identification, referral and management of students with OCD.
