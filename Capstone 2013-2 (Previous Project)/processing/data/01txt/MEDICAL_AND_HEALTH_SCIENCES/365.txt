Foodservice, its organisation and management is one of three essential components of professional practice within dietetics. National minimum standards for competence in foodservice requires practical experience in the workforce which can lead to saturation of professional practice sites. Innovative approaches to fulfil requirements are necessary if competence based learning is to be sustained. A seven day camp for 2200 people was used as a site for students to attain competence in foodservice management. Students completed the three phase planning, implementation and evaluation of the centrally catered foodservice for the residential camp. Phase 1 was the theoretical planning and development of recipes and menus. Recipes were selected to meet the nutritional needs of the camp participants. Phase 2 was the practical application and management of the foodservice system during the camp. Students were divided into semi-autonomous work groups and managed the preparation, distribution and collection of all meals and snacks.  Phase 3 was the evaluation of the project in terms of learning and assessment of competencies. The innovative elements of this teaching were the residential approach, the semi-autonomous work teams, the â€œinability to avoidâ€¿ and the ability of students to receive immediate feedback on their decisions. This style of teaching promoted leadership skills, initiative and flexibility in those that participated as well as reducing the burden of student placements at traditional sites. This opportunity allowed dietetic students to demonstrate competence in foodservice management in an innovative manner while gaining other less tangible skills that  can greatly enhance professional practice
