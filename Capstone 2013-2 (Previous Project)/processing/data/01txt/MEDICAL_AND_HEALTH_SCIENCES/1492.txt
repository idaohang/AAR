Pain of moderate to severe intensity continues to be an important problem for many hospitalized patients.    Nurses spend more time with patients than any other health professional group and have a key role to play in the management of patients' pain.    This paper reports the findings from a series of focus group interviews which were undertaken to explore nurses' perceptions regarding pain and the administration of narcotic analgesia.    Themes identified from participants' comments related to (1) the pivotal role of nurses in pain management; (2) nursing assessment and pain management decisions (3) individual factors influencing nurses' pain management decisions and (4) the influence of others on nurses' pain management decisions.    These findings have implications for further research and the development of innovative educational strategies.
