Introduction &amp; Aims  For displaced intracapsular fractures of the femoral neck the most frequently employed hemiarthroplasty in Australia is the Uncemented Austin Moore (UAM) prosthesis.  Despite concerns regarding the poor functional outcome and increased revision rates associated with the UAM prosthesis, apprehension about the systemic effects of PMMA acrylic cement implantation in the elderly patient continues to influence prosthesis selection.  This study examines the incidence early prosthesis related complications after Uncemented Austin Moore (UAM) and Cemented Thompson (CT) hemiarthroplasty implantation for the management of femoral neck fractures.
