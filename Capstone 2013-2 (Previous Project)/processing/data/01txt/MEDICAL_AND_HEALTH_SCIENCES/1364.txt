The scope of nursing practice in acute care is continually changing. Practices and protocols that provided guidance yesterday are today modified or abandoned. In addition, everything in acute health comes under the economic microscope. Along with the need to rationalise the health dollar also comes the obligation to continue health care that delivers optimal health outcomes. It is these twin aims that form the basis of evidence-based practice; that is, to provide systematically dveloped guidelines for economically efficient and clinically effective practice in order to achieve desired patient outcomes. By knowing which interventions and practices are efficient and effective, wiser clinical decisions can be made about the distribuiton of limited health care resources. As such, evidence-based practice has become an imperative for health professionals and health service researchers.
