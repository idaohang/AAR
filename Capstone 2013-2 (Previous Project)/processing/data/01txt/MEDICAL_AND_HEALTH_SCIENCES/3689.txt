The amount and complexity of information with which nurses have to deal continues to grow exponentially. Support has grown for integrated curriculum approaches that include appropriate instruction in the use of a variety of information formats and instruction which focuses on a resource-based and process approach. This paper argues that collaboration has to be fostered in meaningful ways between teaching faculty and librarians for information literacy enhancement. Such approaches to teaching and learning demand a major shift in educational paradigms and encompass resource-based learning, undergraduate research, service learning inquiry learning and problem-based learning. The implementation of an integrated curriculum promises advanced information skills, access and use of available evidence to support clinical decision making and a foundation for lifetime learning. This paper reports on the rationale of an integrated curriculum, changes to nursing education and obstacles within higher education and workplaces to the development and application of advanced information skills.
