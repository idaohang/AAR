Since it was first described by the Australian ophthalmologist Dr Thomas Spring in 1974, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) or, as it is more commonly know today, contact lens associated papillary conjunctivitis, has been associated primarily with the wearing of soft contact lenses.  However, there are other potential causes, such as rigid gas-permeable contact lenses, sutures, suture knots, an extruded scleral buckle, elevated corneal deposits, cyanoacrylate glue, an elevated filtering bleb and band keratopathy.  The occurrence of GPC has also been reported in patients with ocular prostheses (OP-GPC).  Despite its many aetiological associations and much research, Schmid and Schmid in their recent review of the spectrum of ocular allergy, report that the exact cause of GPC remains elusive.  The condition may be an allergic response to the contact lens itself, deposits on the lens, contact lens solutions or the preservatives therein.  Mechanical trauma to the upper tarsus may also play a role.  They note that it is more common in atopic individuals.  We report on a case of GPC associated with the wearing of an ocular prosthesis.
