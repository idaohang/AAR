The case is presented of a female infant with a distal deletion of 8p (8p23.1 --&gt; pter) whose development was monitored over a 5-year period from 12 months of age. Although previous literature has suggested that Sp deletion is associated with mild to moderate intellectual disability, the child reported here has normal intelligence. Despite initial delays in gross motor and language skills, cognitive development (assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development) and intellectual ability (measured on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale) were within average range. It is argued that the small number of previous case reports may have created a misleading impression of intellectual development in individuals with distal deletions of 8p.
