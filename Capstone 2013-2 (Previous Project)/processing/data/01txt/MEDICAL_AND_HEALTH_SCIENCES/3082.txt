The human cornea reaches a maximum state of oxygen demand after five minutes of total anoxia; after longer periods of anoxia this demand is slightly reduced. An average increase in corneal oxygen demand of 2.5 times was observed for periods of anoxia greater then five minutes. These results are in agreement with those from rabbit eye studies.
