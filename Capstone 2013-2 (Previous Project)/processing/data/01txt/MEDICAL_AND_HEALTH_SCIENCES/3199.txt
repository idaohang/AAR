The effects of rigid contact lens overall diameter changes on tear pump efficiency were studied for lenses of 7 overall diameters (8.2 to 10.0 mm in 0.3-mm steps) while maintaining all other parameters (including a 7.4-mm optic zone diameter) constant. Oxygen uptake rates were measured in the normal, open eye and after static (without blinking) and dynamic (with blinking once every 5 s) wear of oxygen-impermeable (polymethyl methacrylate) contact lenses. Differences between uptake rates obtained under static vs. dynamic conditions served as an index of tear pump efficiency for each lens. Tear pump efficiency increased with the use of progressively smaller lens diameters and subjects with large palpebral aperture sizes were also found to have better tear exchange (r = 0.934, p = 0.006 for the 9.1-mm overall diameter reference lens).
