The aim of this study was to develop a substantive grounded theory describing the relationship between housing, social support, and the mental health of people with schizophrenia. To achieve this aim, data were collected from people with schizophrenia living in boarding houses and living in their own home. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with thirteen people with schizophrenia to explore their experiences and views regarding the impact of their housing on their mental health. Findings indicate a strong desire amongst all participants to live in their own home. When they do they feel they belong, they feel safe and most importantly they have greater opportunities to make and maintain supportive social relationships.
