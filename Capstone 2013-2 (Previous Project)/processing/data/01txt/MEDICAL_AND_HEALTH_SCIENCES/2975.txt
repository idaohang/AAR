The Stroke Knowledge Test (SKT) was developed with the intention of helping people with Stroke.  Stroke is a serious and common health problem.  The SKT is intended for use by health professionals working in the area of stroke.   The test can be used one-on-one or in group settings.  It can be used to assess stroke knowledge among survivors, people at risk of stroke, carers and family members, or support staff working with people who have had stroke.  The aim of this test is to provide a benchmark against which changes in stroke knowledge and understanding might be mapped.  It can also be used to: assist health professionals to tailor their delivery of stroke educations specifically to the needs of a given client; and in research applications.
