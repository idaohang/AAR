It is now well recognized both from clinical and epidemiological studies that exposure to alcohol during pregnancy can produce harmful effects on the foetus and that the extent of the damage done is related to the time of exposure and dose of alcohol ingested. Australia held its first National Foetal Alcohol Syndrome Workshop in May 2002 to bring together an expert advisory committee to examine the issues in Australia.  This paper will address some of the educational, health, financial and social implications of prenatal exposure to alcohol and of caring for children, young people and adults with resultant primary and secondary disabilities. The process of identifying and diagnosing children with the foetal alcohol syndrome and disabilities stemming from prenatal alcohol consumption will be briefly discussed.
