ABSTRACT  Introduction: Technical inadequacy in implantation of the uncemented unipolar Austin Moore Hemiarthroplasty has been associated with early failure of the prosthesis by aseptic loosening and residual thigh pain requiring revision. This study examines the frequency of technical errors experienced during implantation of the Austin Moore prosthesis in a public hospital.  Methods: A Retrospective radiographic and chart review of 147 consecutive uncemented Austin Moore hemiarthoplasties was conducted with particular reference to intraoperative errors associated with early failure of the prosthesis.   Results: 48.3% patients had at least 1 error in implantation. Intraoperative fractures were sustained in 14.3%. Registrars and Consultants had equivalent error rates.   Conclusions: The results from this study imply the uncemented Austin Moore prosthesis is a technically demanding prosthesis that is difficult to implant well, and greater selectivity should be exercised when considering its use for femoral neck fractures.
