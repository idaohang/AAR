With increases in life expectancy and increasing numbers of older patients utilising the acute setting, attitudes of registered nurses caring for older people may affect the quality of care provided. This paper reviews recent research on positive and negative attitudes of acute care nurses toward older people. The many negative attitudes reflect ageist stereotypes and knowledge deficits that significantly influence the practice of registered nurses and the quality of care older patients receive. In the acute setting, older patients experience reduced independence, limited decision making opportunities, increased probability of developing complications, little consideration of their ageing related needs, limited health education and social isolation.
