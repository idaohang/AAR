One hundred consecutively presenting contact lens wearers were questioned about the procedures used in the care and maintenance of their contact lenses and were asked to demonstrate their use of those procedures. The clinic records of the patients were then analysed for the occurrence of signs and symptoms that were potentially related to non-compliance with instructions and procedures, and that could not otherwise be explained. At least one aspect of non-compliant behaviour was seen in 74% of patients. This non-compliance could be correlated with the occurrence of signs indicating potential wearing problems. In particular, specific aspects of non-compliance were associated with the increased incidence of corneal epithelial staining and lens surface deposits. Improvements in the level of patient compliance with instructions is likely to bring about increased patient success with contact lens wear.
