We studied the extent of dehydration of hydrogel lenses during overnight wear. Seven subjects used a hand refractometer to measure the water content of five different lenses (Hydron zero-6 (nominal water content 38.6%), -0.50 D; Snoflex 50 (52.5%), -0.50 and + 15.00 D, and Hydron Z-67 (67.5%), -0.50 and + 15.00 D) before and after 7 h of both open- and closed-eye wear. No statistically significant difference was observed in dehydration between open and closed eye lens wear. Thick and thin lenses made of the same material were found to dehydrate to an equal extent. Contrary to expectations, the medium water content Snoflex 50 lenses displayed a greater absolute decrease in water content than the higher water content Hydron Z-67 lenses (p less than 0.01). Factors that may influence the extent of dehydration under open- and closed-eye wearing conditions, and the clinical implications of these results, are discussed.
