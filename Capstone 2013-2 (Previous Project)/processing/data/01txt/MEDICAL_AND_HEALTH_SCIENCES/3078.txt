The basic concepts associated with thermal disinfection of contact lenses are examined, and the mathematical models used to predict the probability of survival of micro-organisms are described and applied to common ocular pathogens. Based on the examination, a review of the Australian Standard for moist disinfection pf hydrogel contact lenses is recommended. The time-temperature profiles of several commercially available heat disinfection units are established, and their performance in comparison to both surrent and proposed standards is evaluated.
