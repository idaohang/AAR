This paper presents the case of a previously well 72 year old man who spent 86 days in the intensive care unit (ICU) following a remarkable and explosive presentation of the rare condition thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura (TTP). TTP is an intravascular platelet aggregation disorder that, without treatment, is associated with significantly high mortality rates. This paper discusses TTP in terms of its presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management. In addition to TTP, the patient developed a number of comorbidities during his stay in ICU. Particular attention is given to two major problems: acute renal failure and prolonged encephalopathy. These issues, along with the initial diagnosis of TTP, resulted in the patient remaining in ICU for a longer period than otherwise might have been expected. Despite many obstacles, the patient recovered and was discharged from hospital 116 days after initial presentation. (author abstract)
