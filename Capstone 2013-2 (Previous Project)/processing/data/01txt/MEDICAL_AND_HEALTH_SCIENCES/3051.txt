Accommodation stimulus-response function (ASRF) and its relationship to retinal image quality were investigated using a modified wavefront sensor. Ten subjects were presented with six vergence stimuli between 0.17 D and 5 D. For each vergence distance, ocular wavefronts and subjective visual acuity were measured. Wavefronts were analysed for a fixed 3-mm pupil diameter and for natural pupil sizes. Visual Strehl ratio computed in the frequency domain (VSOTF) and retinal images were calculated for each condition tested. Subjective visual acuity was significantly improved at intermediate vergence distances (1 D and 2 D; p&lt;0.01), and only decreased significantly at 5 D compared with 0.17 D (p&lt;0.05). VSOTF magnitude was associated with subjective visual acuity and VSOTF peak location correlated with accommodation error. Apparent accommodation errors due to spherical aberration were highly correlated with accommodation lead and lag for natural pupils (R2 = 0.80) but not for fixed 3-mm pupils (R2 &lt; 0.00). The combination of higher-order aberrations and accommodation errors improved retinal image quality compared with accommodation errors or higher order aberrations alone. Pupil size and higher order aberrations play an important role in the ASRF.
