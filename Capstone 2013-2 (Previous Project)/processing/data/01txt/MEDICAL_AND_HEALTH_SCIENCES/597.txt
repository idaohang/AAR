Background.  The development of paediatric home healthcare is underpinned by three principles: first to increase the quality of life of patients and families, second to decrease cost and the length of hospital stay, and third to promote community participation in healthcare delivery.  With the advancement of technology and the transformation of healthcare delivery, an increasing number of children who are chronically ventilator-dependent are been discharged to home.    Aim.  The aim was to investigate and describe the qualitative experiences of primary caregivers who care for ventilator-dependent children at home.    Methods.  Phenomenography was chosen as the qualitative research approach for the study.  Seventeen primary caregivers who cared for a ventilator-dependent child at home were recruited from four states of Australia.    Findings.  Seven categories of description and an outcome space are the research outcomes.  The care-giving experience was understood as (1) â€œhospital is another world to meâ€¿; (2) â€œitâ€™s a new worldâ€¿; (3) an ambiguous social identity; (4) the medical technology with my child is frightening but necessary; (5) â€œthe difficulty is having the carers at homeâ€¿; (6) social isolation; and (7) the experience as changing as a person.    Conclusion.  The outcomes of the study reveal the significant and distinctive nature of the care-giving experiences of the primary caregivers.  The outcomes emerged from the study are germane to clinical practice development, health education, policy formulation, and research development in paediatric home healthcare.
