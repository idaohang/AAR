The effects of rigid contact lens axial edge lift changes on corneal oxygenation and tear exchange with the blink were studied for lenses of five axial edge lifts (0.05 to 0.13 mm in 0.02-mm steps). The overall and optic zone diameters were maintained at 8.8 and 7.4 mm, respectively, and all other parameters were held constant. Oxygen uptake rates were measured for the normal open eye after 5 min of static (without blinking) and dynamic (with blinking once every 5 s) contact lens wear. As expected, no significant differences were found in the oxygen uptake rates associated with the static wear of the contact lenses; however, under dynamic conditions, increasing edge lift was associated with a reduction in oxygen demand. The differences between data obtained under static and dynamic conditions increased with increasing axial edge lift, and subjects with small palpebral aperture sizes seemed to benefit more from increasing axial edge lift.
