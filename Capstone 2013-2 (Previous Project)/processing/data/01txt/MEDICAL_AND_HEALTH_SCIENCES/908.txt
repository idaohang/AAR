The personal UV exposure levels of a group of welders and nearby works has been estimated using a photosensitive polymer film, polysulphone. The polysulphone film was attached to eye protection, and workers clothing and also placed throughout the workarea. the estimated ocular exposure for all aubjects were found to exceed the maximum permissible exposure limit. The results sugguest welders require ocular protection on addition to welding helmets and any exposured skin area of workers on this environment also requires protection.
