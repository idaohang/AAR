For married males recovery from myocardial infarction (MI) takes place within the context of the couple's relationship, and the way in which patients and their spouses perceive the patient's functioning is likely to be important to patients' quality of life. Our study examined patient and spouse perspectives of patients' physical functioning, self-efficacy in relation to recovery from MI, and the degree to which that self-efficacy depended upon the spouse, in a consecutive series of 104 married males (M = 56.9 years of age; SD = 10.2) who were recruited while hospitalised with a first MI. Additionally, we investigated perceptions of their sexual relationship. Participants completed self-report instruments during an interview following the patientsâ€™ discharge from hospital (M = 35.9 days post-MI; SD = 10.5). An analysis of response agreement showed that spouses, as a group, rated patient physical functioning, self-efficacy, and dependence on spouse for self-efficacy at a lower level than did patients themselves (56.7%, 61.5%, and 52.9% respectively). Patients and spouses tended to disagree (45.2%) on the level of change in their sexual relationship since the MI. Given that self-efficacy is known to be an important determinant of patient recovery, and that patientsâ€™ self-efficacy may be influenced by others, health professionals need to consider including spouses of post-MI patients in cardiac rehabilitation programs that address the concerns of both partners.
