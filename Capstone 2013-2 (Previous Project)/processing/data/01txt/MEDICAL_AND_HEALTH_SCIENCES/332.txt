This phenomenological study describes the lived experience of spouses whose partners have suffered a myocardial infarction. In-depth interviews were conducted with three participants (two females and one male) about their experiences. The findings from the participants were analysed using Giorgiâ€™s method (1985). Informantsâ€™ experiences were captured within five major themes: (i) crushing uncertainty, (ii) overwhelming emotional turmoil, (iii) the need for support, (iv) the lack of information heightened anxiety and (v) the acceptance of lifestyle changes. The implications from this study suggest that health care workers need to: embellish their skills in managing spousesâ€™ emotions; communicate with community health professionals regarding support systems; provide families with information concerning the emotional issues associated with MI; provide advice in terms of financial aid; and identify community support groups if these are required. The in-depth knowledge gained from the study will enable nurses to understand how family members feel when a spouse/partner has suffered an MI. It will also provide a framework with which practitioners and families can understand their reactions and assist in the overall rehabilitation of clients.
