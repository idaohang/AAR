Initial calls for universal screening for domestic violence by health care workers date back over two decades (Hillard 1985). During the early 1990â€™s the agenda was subsequently driven by the introduction of medical and nursing guidelines supporting the procedure (Braham et al 1992, ACOG Technical Bulletin 1995). These guidelines provided a health related rationale for screening and screening methods and tools that were tailored for use in health care settings. Since that time and despite a general reluctance by health care providers, the momentum for routine screening has increased. This is partly because governments, both state and national, have made domestic violence prevention a major priority and have supported the introduction of screening programs into health care facilities (Webster 1994) and partly due to a changing cultural perception of domestic violence as both an important criminal and public health issue (Webster 1996).
