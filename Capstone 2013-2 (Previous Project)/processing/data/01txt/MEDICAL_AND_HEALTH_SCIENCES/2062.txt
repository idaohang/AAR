The question posed for this keynote address is deliberately controversial, of course, but although the issues are still to become fully apparent, I believe that the controversy I want to discuss is real and will become pressing.  We start with the two key terms that give us our issue, â€˜oldâ€™ and â€˜rehabilitationâ€™, and then attempt to contextualise the issue, reflecting along the way on why our question is beginning to be asked so often, even if rarely as explicitly as we are doing today.
