This paper describes the development, implementation and evaluation of a transfer brochure for family members of patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) to improve patient transfer to a general ward. When family members fail to understand information, they respond in ways that affect patient recovery. The brochure was designed within Knowles' Adult Learning Theory framework and developed using a multidisciplinary team. A mixed design was used to collect data from families and nurses. Results indicate that the brochure helped nurses to address the individual family's issues during transfer from ICU. Furthermore, 95% of nurses (n = 33) recommended its introduction for all future transfers. Family members (n = 82) who received the brochure as part of their transfer were significantly more satisfied with all aspects of transfer than those who experienced ad hoc transfer methods (n = 80). These results provide strong support for Knowles' Adult Learning Theory as an educational foundation for adult learning.
