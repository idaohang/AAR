The nature of R&amp;D and innovation within the creative and content industries  generally has not been closely examined. This largely reflects the sorry fact that  these industries have tended to be at the fringes of national discussions about  science and innovation policy, and of related funding and industry programmes. A  further complication is that there is little systematic data about the extent and nature  of R&amp;D activity and funding in the creative industries in general and for digital content  production in particular.  The use of the term &quot;digital content&quot; implies a marriage of content and technology.  Also obviously, digital content represents a new and emerging market, an  &quot;innovation frontier&quot;. Thus digital content constitutes a case study in innovation  and change in those industry domains within which digital content firms operate, and  for those industries in which digital content is becoming an important input and  enabler, particularly education and other service sector industries.  This current study has been part of a multi-stage programme of work examining  digital content production and applications within creative industries, and the extent  to which an industry cluster is developing, or could develop, around digital content  activities. The programme's focus on possible clustering provides a natural  springboard for extending the study into this area of innovation systems and the role  of research and development.  This report is organised around the three primary objectives for the study, as follows:  1. The industry's innovation system  2. Issues in optimising the industry's innovation systems  3. Possible intervention strategies.
