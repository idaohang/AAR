Brisbane is the kind of city that if it did not exist would have to be invented and indeed it has by many of its writers. Its history of settlement and its political conservatism of the slash, bum and bulldoze variety has urged writers Sam Watson in his novel The Kadaitcha Sung to depict it as a place of punishment, violence, racism and red-necked parochialism. The same sense of oppression  informs David Maloufâ€™s mixed nostalgic references to the city as a place of beauty and boredom, a city you can love and hate in Johnno. In similar vein, Jessica Anderson in Tirra Lira by the River, Angelika Fremd in The Glass Inferno and Janette Turner Hospital in both short stories and novels, depicted Brisbane as a place one needs to leave but also a place where epiphanies are possible, and where the past haunts the present with a ferocious insistence, For novelists Rosie Scott, Janette Turner Hospital and Venero Armanno, Brisbane is simultaneously Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained. Many writers depict Brisbane as a great place to grow up in but you wouldn't want to live there - unless you are Hugh Lunn. Brisbane has been, and arguably still is by some writers, seen both favourably and unfavourably as a provincial backwater, unsophisticated and straight - still a frontier town in the popular and literary imagination if not in reality -  a place where it is likely that you will know somebody who knows somebody you know.
