This paper considers Freud's notion of the uncanny in relation to a selection of Canadian picture books that look at stories of immigration. The discussion considers how each of the female protagonists experiences the uncanny as she adjusts to life in Canada and comes to terms with her sense of difference and longing. By taking an uncanny reading of the texts, ideas of home, identity, and belonging are unsettled in ways that invite readers to reconsider how the texts under discussion engage with these concepts.
