I would like to propose, from a social semiotic (cf. Lemke, 1990; 1995; 1996) or ecological perspective (Maturana &amp; Varela, 1991; 1992), that intuition, tacit knowledge, and feelings may be signs of personal and social meaning-systemswhich, although generally below conscious awareness, may significantly affect a researcher's work processes and meaning-making. I will argue that investigating, analysing and reporting such signs in oneself and others should enhance the resolution of inconsistencies between meaning systems and practice. They may also play a significant role in processes involved in problem solving and creativity. I believe, therefore, that they have a legitimate place in both research and research reports.
