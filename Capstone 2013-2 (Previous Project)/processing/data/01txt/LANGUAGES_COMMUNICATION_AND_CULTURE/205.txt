Digital transmission technologies have brought with them the promise of a better picture for all.  The new system is said to provide better quality transmission, an increase in the number of services and a new dimension in broadcasting experience through audience participation.  For the community sector, however, digital television is threatening the survival of current services.  Whilst access, decentralisation, and participation have become key words of the transition phase, there is a risk that, in the application and development of digital transmission systems, prior broadcasting patterns of concentrated ownership control will prevail.  This paper attempts to define the challenges involved in securing a public space in Australian television's new landscape and anlyses the impact of the digital legislation on the public sphere.  recent developments indicate that the democratic forum of community television may need more support than ever before.
