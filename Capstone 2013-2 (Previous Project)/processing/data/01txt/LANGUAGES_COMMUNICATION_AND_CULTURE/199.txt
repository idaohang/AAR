This paper proposes that interactive technologies can combine with training and enterprise development, and young peopleâ€™s desires for content creation, to establish a network of users across differing geographical and social ecologies, creating new cultural forms and economic outcomes. The research project described merges innovative internet design, policy analysis and ethnographic methods. Young people from urban, regional, remote and Indigenous environments will learn, network, and create their own content on a Youth Internet Radio Network, contributing to community capacity building.  Analysis will describe and influence the creative, social and technical processes, and identify opportunities for innovation, enterprise development and regional sustainability.
