In this paper, we describe the development of interactive software to accompany Yookoso (Tohsaku 1999), the textbook in use in the first two years of the Japanese language course at Queensland University of Technology. We begin with a discussion of what is meant by interactivity; we then examine the advantages of using the software in association with the textbook package, as opposed to using the textbook package alone. We also discuss the importance of integrating multimedia materials into the curriculum and the role of the teacher in this model of â€˜blended learningâ€™. It is hoped the paper will prove useful to those who are considering implementing or have already implemented a CALL component in their Japanese language program.
