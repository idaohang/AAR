The exponential growth of contacts and networks among educators around the world in an increasingly globalised market exists in a context of local and global inequality and stratification. Conflicting interests and agendas emerging from international collaborations have? spurred the need for a theoretical model that can critically explore and reflexively assess the dynamics of international educational collaborations. In a previous paper, we put forth a model for socially just collaboration that is informed by feminist writings of Young and Fraser. In this current paper we problematise simplistic classificatory uses of such a model. Further, using data from a study of globalisation trends in mathematics education, we illustrate the use of this model for critical assessment and analysis of social justice issues by dispelling singular classification schemata.
