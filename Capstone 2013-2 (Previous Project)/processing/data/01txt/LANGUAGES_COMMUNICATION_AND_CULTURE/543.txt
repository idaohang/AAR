The extent to which photographs of Oceania facilitated learning-by-looking and educated the reading public is an important historical characteristic of the early 20th century boom in photographically illustrated media - postcards, stereographs, gift albums, illustrated magazines, journals, weekend newspapers and serial encyclopaedia. A century later these same black and white images circulate in the public domain as posters, video covers, museum installations and book illustrations educating a 21st century audience about an imagined (historical) and actual (contemporary) Oceania.
