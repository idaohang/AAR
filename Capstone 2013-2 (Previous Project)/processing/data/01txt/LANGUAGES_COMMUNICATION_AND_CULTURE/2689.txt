Much has been written on Michel Foucaultâ€™s reluctance to clearly delineate a research method, particularly with respect to genealogy (Harwood, 2000; Meadmore, Hatcher, &amp; McWilliam, 2000; Tamboukou, 1999).  Foucault (1994: 288) himself disliked prescription stating, &quot;I take care not to dictate how things should be&quot; and wrote provocatively to disrupt equilibrium and certainty, so that &quot;all those who speak for others or to others&quot; no longer know what to do.  It is doubtful, however, that Foucault ever intended for researchers to be stricken by that malaise to the point of being unwilling to make an intellectual commitment in outlining methodological possibilities.  The aim of this paper is to develop what might be called a discursive analytic from Foucaultâ€™s work and related poststructural writings in order to provide this researcher with a clear doctoral itinerary but also to do others the courtesy of leaving a clearly identifiable trail.
