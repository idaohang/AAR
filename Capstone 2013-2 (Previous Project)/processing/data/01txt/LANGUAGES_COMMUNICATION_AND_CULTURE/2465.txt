What would an innovation systems approach to the creative and especially the digital content industries look like? This is important for two reasons: such an approach may open up dynamic and central policy territory which has been the preserve of science, engineering and technology (SET) worldwide; and it asks new questions, outside the domain of cultural support, which may precipitate a more holistic approach to the creative industries. This article draws on aspects of a report produced as part of the Australian Governmentâ€™s Creative Industries Cluster Study which outlined key elements of such a system. It focuses on the issues raised in looking at the role of key public institutions such as research agencies, educational and training bodies, including universities, government support agencies and others.  We argue that these elements need to be greatly strengthened as well as challenged in terms of their orientation and their capacity to contribute to the innovation system.
