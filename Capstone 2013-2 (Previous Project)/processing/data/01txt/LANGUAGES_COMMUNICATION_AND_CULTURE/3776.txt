Digital Storytelling (by which I mean the model associated with the Center for Digital Storytelling and adapted by Daniel Meadows for Capture Wales BBC) as a â€˜movementâ€™ is explicitly designed to amplify the ordinary voice.  It aims not only to remediate vernacular creativity, but to legitimate it as a relatively autonomous and worthwhile contribution to public culture.
