The book provides an exposition on the discipline of information management. It is organised into four parts. The first of these deals with factors that shape the meaning of information management - the professional associations that have formed; the science of information; and corporate approaches to consideration of information as an enterprise resource. The following three parts explain how information management is undertaken in three domains: operational, analytical and administrative. The operational domain details techniques that are concerned with processing  information about information - the organising structures, finding aids, classification and retrieval systems, that make their respective information systems useable. The analytical domain is concerned with determining enterprise and user information requirements; undertaking requirements analysis; information audits; and evaluation of information operations. The administrative domain is concerned with the strategic approach â€“ fostering effective utilisation of information and knowledge resources using a planning framework that aligns information services with that of an enterpriseâ€™s objectives and resourcing, and works effectively within constraints imposed by the broader regulatory and business environment.
