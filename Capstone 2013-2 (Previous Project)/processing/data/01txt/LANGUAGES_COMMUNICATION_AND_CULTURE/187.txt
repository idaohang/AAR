Current communication research into online communities is strongly directed at peer-topeer networks and virtual communities which are dispersed and not linked to any one physical location. The popularity of these internet communities can be attributed to the way they enable the exchange of information based on interest, practice, commerce, or support needs, and how members can easily establish social relations with each other.  Within a local context, the internet holds the potential to grow strong and social capital rich communities of place which foster civic engagement, trust amongst residents and acts of reciprocity. However, this does not happen automatically, and there is a lack of understanding how local communities can make the technology work for them. Thus, new research is needed to inform the design process of online communication networks to grow sustainable communities of place.
