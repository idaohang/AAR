This paper explores how to support the building of networks and network social capital in place-based communities through the use of internet and personal communications technologies. The trends away from conventional neighbourhood interactions to interactions centred around the workplace, personal interests and personalised networking are examined. Through a case study, new forms of interactions in neighbourhoods are identified. Preliminary implications for the support of neighbourhood interactions as well as a framework for understanding community interactions are presented.
