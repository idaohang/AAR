This paper discusses the evolution of television serial drama in China. It argues that Chinese television drama production has progressed through three periods: industrial (1958 â€“ 1989), market (1990 â€“ 2002), and most recently interpersonal (2003 onwards). These three stages of development are in turn associated with standardised production according to state directed formulas, outbreaks of producer autonomy, and celebration of modern lifestyles and consumer culture. The paper provides an overview of the development of drama production during these three periods, and notes a shift from â€˜socialist realityâ€™ towards contemporary popular reality.
