Recent years have seen the emergence of a new genre of user-driven Websites engaged in a novel form of news reporting which has been described as open publishing or open news, in analogy to the open source movement. These sites combine news, rumours and background information as well as community discussion and commentary on their chosen topic, and frequently serve as a first point of entry for readers interested in learning more about the field. Examples include Slashdot (http://slashdot.org/), Openflows News (http://news.openflows.org/), Kuro5hin (http://www.kuro5hin.org/), but beyond this group of sites which operate mainly in the Internet policy and technology sector -  roviding 'news for nerds', as Slashdot describes itself - open news sites can now also  be found in many other fields of interest from politics to entertainment
