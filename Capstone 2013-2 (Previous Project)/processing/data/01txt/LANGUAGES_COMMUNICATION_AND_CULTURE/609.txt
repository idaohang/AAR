This paper will examine how policy in Australia is underpinning the development of a national innovation system in the cultural industries. I make distinctions between innovation and creativity. Specific examples come from digital content industries in Australia. I will suggest that many of the policies that Australia has adopted, and is considering, have relevance for China. While there are distinctions that can be drawn between cultural industries and creative industries, in this paper the terms are used interchangeably.
