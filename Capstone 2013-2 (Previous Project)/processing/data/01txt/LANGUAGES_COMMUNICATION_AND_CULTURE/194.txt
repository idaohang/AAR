This paper addresses emerging methodologies and technologies for the distribution of canonical cultural studies content in new economy structures. Recent developments in Creative Industries frameworks and attendant languages have drawn attention to the issues raised in linking creative content with wider industrial applications. The example of this process, to be outlined in this paper, is the merging of the myriad cultural associations and entrenched applications inherent in Shakespearean studies in Australia with creative business clusters, such as Bell Shakespeare, in order to develop new creative enterprises and add to the use-value of the primary content. In this context, this paper will demonstrate the digital platform being developed currently via QUT to deliver such established content into new cultural formations. This is an interdisciplinary and cross-institutional project that will focus on contemporary Australian outcomes. Questions that arise from the teaching of cultural studies approaches in relation to Shakespearean texts and the complexities added when those approaches are delivered in the context of the new Creative Industries focus will also be addressed. Recent discussions have revealed the problematic status of teaching Shakespearean studies in contemporary environments. Product 'Shakespeare,' always a problematic consumable deployed by, and for, varying political and social aims, is moving in new directions, such as corporate business training. New technologies offer much to such divergent interests but also raise important political and social questions, particularly in relation to non-Eurocentric cultures. This paper is an attempt to consider some of the methodologies, and the technologies, involved in the latest round of appropriations of Shakespearean studies.
