Information literacy is about peopleâ€™s information practices in their ICT environment. Increasing access to ICTs to bridge the digital divide has implications for the information literacy needs of people in developing communities. The research described in this paper, investigated development workersâ€™ perceptions of information literacy needs amongst local staff participating in community development projects in cross-cultural situations. A phenomenographic approach was used to elicit five hierarchically related, qualitatively different understandings of information literacy needs within the development context.  The results reveal possible directions for those workers involved in bringing ICTs into workplace settings within developing communities.
