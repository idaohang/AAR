Internationalisation of the high school student body is firmly on the agenda in state education in Queensland and many other states in Australia. Fee-paying students from overseas, principally neighbouring Asian countries, have long been finding their way into mainstream high school classrooms via private language colleges that provide intensive language and content high school preparation courses. Recently, such students have been actively recruited as a result of advancing international policy at the macro state level. This new strategy to enroll overseas students in high schools means that there is a growing demand for language preparation courses to introduce those students, whose language proficiency is lower than the level expected by high schools, to the language, content and cultural requirements of the high school curriculum. Inevitably, this raises questions about the relationship between the nature of high school preparation (hereafter HSP) courses and the constantly evolving mainstream high school curriculum itself. At a recent teachersâ€™ conference, a group of secondary English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers remarked that those students who come to high school via HSP are disadvantaged if they are only â€˜preparedâ€™ in traditional language education ways for a system that now requires a more critical approach to language study. This paper outlines some of the issues and difficulties surrounding the incorporation of critical literacy into HSP course design and presents one example of how a HSP course has begun to integrate a critical perspective on language study into an existing program.
