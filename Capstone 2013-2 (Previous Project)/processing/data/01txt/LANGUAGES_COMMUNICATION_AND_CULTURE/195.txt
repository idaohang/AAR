This paper undertakes an institutional analysis of the recent strategies for corporate expansion undertaken by News Corporation and AOL-Time Warner. It outlines the central elements of an institutional approach to media analysis, noting its relationship to critical political economy. Observing that the core proposition of such an approach is that corporations seek control over their external environment, but questioning the proposition that enterprise size is itself a guarantee of such control, it contrasts the recent strategies of News Corporation and AOL-Time Warner, in relation to globalisation, cross-media platform development and synergistic expansion. It argues that News Corporation is a global media enterprise in ways that AOL-Time Warner is not, and that the key to this expansion has been a willingness to let go of control through strategic partnerships and joint ventures. By contrast, AOL-Time Warnerâ€™s search for synergistic expansion through merger has largely proved illusory, whereas a â€˜network enterpriseâ€™ strategy, that eschewed expansion and control in favour of strategic partnership, may have proved more successful.
