This paper looks at programming strategies adopted by Chinese television producers, drawing on an ongoing large-scale study of Asia-Pacific television format trade currently being conducted by the Australian Key Centre for Cultural and Media Policy. The paper argues that the concept of cultural technology transfer is a useful way of theorizing the positive benefits of program replication in China. On the other hand, the negative effect is that dynamics of program development and innovation are retarded by excessive reliance on the cloning of formats.
