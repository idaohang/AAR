This paper explores the verbal and non-verbal interactions of children in a preschool classroom. It analyses an episode in the block area to show the competent ways that some young boys use communication strategies to build their social worlds. Such understandings invite early childhood educators to reconsider young children's communicative competence and the ways they accomplish their social order.
