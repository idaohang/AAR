This paper analyses and critiques the Queensland Government's Research and Development (R&amp;D) strategy that undergirds the smart state policy agenda.  We argue that this strategy poorly addresses: R&amp;D opportunities deriving from the applied social and creative disciplines; and the role of the social and creative disciplines in the development and commercialisation process for all research. Furthermore, we suggest this derives from a view of 'smart' which is biased towards science and technology.
