This paper offers a detailed analysis of the speech practices of pre-school aged children engaged in their daily play and interactions by adopting a perspective that recognises young children organising social membership through talk and activity. A reading based on traditional early childhood practices and theories is contrasted with an alternative reading which shows children constructing gendered social membership. This reading constitutes children as persons of gender and power by showing how children are positioned (and position themselves) as teachers, learners and players engaged in their daily play and interactions.
