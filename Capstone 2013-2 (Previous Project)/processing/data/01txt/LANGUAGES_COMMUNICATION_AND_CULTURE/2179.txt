This paper investigates stories that are told in a North Queensland rural community about the arrival of itinerant farm workers for the winter harvesting season.  Permanent residents often represent this annual event as an invasion of the community by undesirable people who break the law, exacerbate racial tensions and take jobs from locals.  Such stories are also heard in the communityâ€™s schools where significant numbers of itinerant children enrol during the harvesting season.  In the face of sometimes hostile reception from permanent residents of the community, many itinerant families work hard to &quot;fit in&quot;, trying to ensure positive experiences for their children.  This paper explores some of the stories that circulate and examines the way that negative perceptions of itinerant families tend to restrict the communityâ€™s capacity to recognise the benefits that families could contribute to community life.
