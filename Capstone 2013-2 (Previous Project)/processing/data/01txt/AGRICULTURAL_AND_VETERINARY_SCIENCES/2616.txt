The effectiveness of polyacrylamides, gypsum, and their combination on improving the physical and chemical properties of a sodic soil was assessed in relation to the response of soybeans to such amelioration procedures. The results of a glasshouse study conducted in the 2002-03 summer season, clearly demonstrated that the polyacrylamides used either alone, or combined with gypsum, were effective in the amelioration of a sodic soil. It was also found that there was a significant beneficial effect on grain yield of soybeans when polyacrylamides and gypsum applications were combined. Soybean plants responded positively to such amelioration procedures. The application of polyacrylamides alone (10 kg/ha) increased the grain yield by 15%, but when combined with gypsum (25-100 kg/ha), polyacrylamides increased the grain yield by 22%. On the other hand, gypsum application alone (25-100 kg/ha) increased the grain yield by only 3%. These findings suggest that sodic soils could be ameliorated with the application of a low quantity of gypsum (25-100 kg/ha) combined with polyacrylamides (10 kg/ha). This may have great impact on large-scale reclamation of sodic soils in Australia, and consequently could significantly increase crop production in these soils.
