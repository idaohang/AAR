Polyacrylamides (PAM) are used in many countries for the improvement of soil physical properties. Interest among researchers in using polyacrylamides in Australian agriculture is steadily increasing over the past few years. Soils with hardsetting properties are widespread in Australia and render difficulties for the germination of seeds of many crops. Crop production in coarse-textured soils is limited due to low water holding capacity of these soils. Sodic soils in rice growing areas create turbidity of water that seriously affects the successful establishment of rice seedlings. This paper explores the possible applications of PAM to remedy these problems.
