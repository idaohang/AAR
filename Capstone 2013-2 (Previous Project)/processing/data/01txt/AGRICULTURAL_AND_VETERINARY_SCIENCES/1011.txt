Abstract Only  Species of tropical fruit-flies (Diptera: Tephritidae: Dacinae) are the number one horticultural pest in the Pacific region.  In Papua New Guinea (PNG), limiting the movement of fresh fruits and vegetables (= fresh commodities) between different regions within the country is one plant protection strategy that could lessen the threat posed by fruit-flies by restricting the spread of both exotic and indigenous pest species.  In order to assess the risk posed by informal fruit and vegetable movement, we carried out a survey of PNG domestic airline passengers.  Of 1904 passengers surveyed, 38.9% were carrying fresh commodities.  Over 70 different fresh commodities were being carried, with the most common being bananas and peanuts, each being carried by over 9% of passengers.  Thirty-four of these 70 commodities are known fruit-fly hosts from PNG or other countries.  Sixty-three percent of passengers on flights into the National Capital District (i.e. Port Moresby) were carrying fruit, as were 74% of passengers leaving the Highland Provinces.   Neither the purpose of travel nor the occupation type of a passenger influenced the likelihood of commodity carriage.  Nearly all commodities came from gardens or local markets and were being carried predominantly for personal consumption or gifts.  With fruit-fly infestation rates of susceptible crops being around 20%, we conclude that the risk of transport of fruit-flies is very high.
