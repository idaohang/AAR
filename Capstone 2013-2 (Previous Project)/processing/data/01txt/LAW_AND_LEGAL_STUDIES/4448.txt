A wide range of research methods and comparative approaches need to be employed to provide basic data on the prevalence and severity of the various types of cyber â€“crime now confronted. In addition research on the effectiveness of new laws, policing strategies and prosecution via case review and attrition studies are crucial.  Research must not be limited to police or court data and these sources often need to be more specific and uniform. Amongst the most pressing research questions is to learn more about victim and offender behaviour, as well as keeping track of legislative and enforcement developments across the globe. Mechanisms for the commissioning and sharing of research need to be developed that involve partnerships or networks between industry, government, academia and grass-root groups.
