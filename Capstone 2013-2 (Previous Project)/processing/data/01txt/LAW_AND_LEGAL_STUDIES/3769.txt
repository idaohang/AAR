The rapid expansion of computer connectivity has provided opportunities for criminals to exploit security vulnerabilities in the on-line environment. Most detrimental are malicious and exploit codes that interrupt computer operations on a global scale and along with other cyber-crimes threaten e-commerce.   Cyber-crime is often traditional crime (e.g. fraud, identify theft, child pornography) albeit executed swiftly and to vast numbers of potential victims, as well as unauthorised access, damage and interference to computer systems. The cross-national nature of most computer related crimes have rendered many time-honoured methods of policing both domestically and in cross-border situations ineffective even in advanced nations, while the â€˜digital divideâ€™ provides â€˜safe havensâ€™ for cyber-criminals. In response to the threat of cyber-crime there is an urgent need to reform methods of mutual legal assistance and to develop trans-national policing capability. The international response is briefly outlined in the context of the United Nations Transnational Organised Crime Convention (in force from September 2003) and the Council of Europeâ€™s innovative Cybercrime Convention (in force from July 2004). In addition the role of the United Nations, Interpol, other institutions and bi-lateral, regional and other efforts aimed a creating a seamless web of enforcement against cyber-criminals are described. The potential for potent global enforcement mechanisms are discussed.
