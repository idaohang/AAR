Using a simulated civil trial, the present experiment was designed to examine the potential role played by the gender of  an expert witness on jurorsâ€™ decisions in both gender congruent and gender incongruent domains.  Specifically, the gender of a plaintiff's expert, as well as the domain of the case (gender congruent or gender incongruent), were systematically varied within a civil trial involving an antitrust price-fixing agreement.  It was expected that the male expert would be more persuasive in the male congruent case (i.e., construction industry), whereas the female expert would be more persuasive in the female congruent case (i.e., womenâ€™s clothing industry).  As predicted, this interaction was revealed across a range of the dependent measures, but the differential advantage of the gender congruency of the expert was primarily confined to the male congruent case.  That is, participants rendered more favorable decisions for the plaintiff in the male congruent case when the expert was male, as opposed to female.
