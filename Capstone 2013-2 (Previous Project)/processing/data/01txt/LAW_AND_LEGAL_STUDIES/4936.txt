How many directorships are too many?  Globally, normative advice emphasises the importance of limiting the number of directorships any individual should hold due to the workloads they entail.  However, there is little empirical evidence to support this view.  Rather, there is a strong tradition of supporting multiple directorships as a mechanism for the firm to co-opt external resources.  To explore the issue of director workloads and multiple directorships, we first consider the issues related to multiple directorships and outline the conclusions of extant international and Australian studies into multiple directorships.  We then detail our objectives in undertaking this research and our approach to data collection.      Our findings indicate that the incidence of multiple directorships in Australian listed companies is low.  We also find that many of the apparent examples of multiple directorships are due to related entities, which share common directors and, due to the nature of these entities, have much lower workload requirements.  Further, there does not appear to be any relationship between holding multiple directorships and firm financial performance.  Finally, we discuss the implications for boards and those interested in governance, particularly the need to ensure governance recommendations and guidelines reflect empirical findings.  We offer one solution to address the concerns of boards, investors, other stakeholders and the community regarding multiple directorships: board and individual director evaluations.
