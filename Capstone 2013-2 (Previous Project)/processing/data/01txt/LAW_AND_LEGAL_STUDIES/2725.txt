Research is currently considered to be central to Australiaâ€™s success in the global knowledge economy. To improve Australiaâ€™s position, the Commonwealth Government has developed a new research paradigm. This paradigm emphasises research outcomes and excellence in research training.  The governmentâ€™s aim is for young researchers to be nurtured in an environment that provides relevant experience, delivers high quality learning, and values creativity and talent.  This paper argues that research assistants have been an undervalued part of many faculties research culture and that more careful employment and training of research assistants in Australian law faculties will not only improve research outcomes, but also provide a highly effective method of nurturing future academic researchers.
