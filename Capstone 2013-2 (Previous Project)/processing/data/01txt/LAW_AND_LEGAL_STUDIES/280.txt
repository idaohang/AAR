The incarceration of a mother usually brings considerable dislocation to the offending women's children and family. This paper examines current policies for the inmate mother, for her children and for the caregiver(s) of her children on the outside in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The study found that while inmate mothers need support from 'significant others' within and outside the prison to cope with the dual roles of prisoner and mother, the custodial enviornment with its philosophy of incarceration, its mode of containment and its rules and regulations runs counter to such needs.
