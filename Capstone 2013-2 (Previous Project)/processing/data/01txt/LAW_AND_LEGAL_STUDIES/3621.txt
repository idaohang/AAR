The Internet and associated digital technologies provide us with an  enormous potential to access and build information and knowledge  networks. Information and knowledge can be communicated in an instant  across the globe, cheaply and with good quality, by even the most basic  Internet user. In short, recent developments in digital technology have  opened up a vast new landscape for knowledge management.    However copyright law which takes definition from international  conventions and is similar in most countries provides that you cannot  reproduce or communicate copyright material (literary, dramatic,  musical and artistic works, films and sound recordings) without the  permission of the copyright owner subject to exceptions for fair  use/dealing, private use and educational use. Private use and educational  use exceptions are usually subject to the payment of a statutory levy,  royalty or licence fee.    Therefore while the technology has the capacity, the legal restrictions on  the reuse of copyright material, hampers its negotiability in the digital  environment. Copyright owners are not obliged to give permission to  allow others to reuse their material even with payment of fair  compensation unless they are compelled to do so by the law. There are  some compulsory licences â€“ for example I can make a recording of any  song pursuant to a compulsory licence - but they are not widespread.  Going through the process of obtaining permission to reuse copyright  material can also be very time consuming and expensive.
