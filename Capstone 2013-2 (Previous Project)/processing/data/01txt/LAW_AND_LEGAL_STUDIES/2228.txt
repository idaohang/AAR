The seminal case in the context of limitation periods under the Trade Practices Act 1974 is the High Court decision in Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514.  While the High Court concluded that a plaintiff should not be required to commence a claim until the existence of his or her loss is ascertained or ascertainable, the decision was limited to consideration of contingent loss under an indemnity. While it is accepted that the meaning of 'ascertainable loss' in the context of a pure contingency is clear, several decisions since Wardley have applied the principle of ascertainable loss to losses which are not readily identifiable as 'contingent'.   This article critiques the concept of 'ascertainable loss' with the aim of determining whether the conceptual framework for ascertaining when the relevant limitation period commences should adopt â€˜contingent lossâ€™ as its core principle or a broader concept based on â€˜ascertainable loss.â€™
