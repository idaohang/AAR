In the world of copyright and intellectual property Australia is a relatively small player. Nevertheless, it has its own tradition of law making, a thriving creative and cultural sector, and is a net importer of intellectual property (â€œIPâ€¿) in terms of both scholarly literature covering science, technology and social sciences, and also entertainment. Its size means that it has some interesting points of comparison with Nordic countries.  These include not only the relative impact of its own export of IP, and dependency on the import of IP, but also the fact that its society is technologically advanced with a high degree of internet penetration and use of digital technology and digitally stored information and knowledge.
