This chapter overviews the legal issues arising from the modification of the Sony PlayStation console under Australian Copyright Law - the so called anti-circumvention provisions. It will explain how these provisions have been interpreted by the courts and focus on the very recent decision of the Australian High Court.  The article concludes by examining the extent to which the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) will impact upon this area of law.
