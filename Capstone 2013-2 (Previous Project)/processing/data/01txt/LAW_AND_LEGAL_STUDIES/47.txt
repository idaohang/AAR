This paper describes how copyright compliance is managed in a large Australian university, with consideration of both the role the university library plays and also how copyright matters external to the library are managed. The paper looks at the changes in distribution technology and copyright legislation over the last decade, and examines the changes in the Universityâ€™s ability to disseminate teaching materials, as well as the changes in the requirements for managing the use of copyright material.
