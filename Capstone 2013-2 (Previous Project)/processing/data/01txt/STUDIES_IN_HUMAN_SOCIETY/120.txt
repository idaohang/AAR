Sociologists have argued that ethnic identity was something that people automatically had by virtue of belonging to a culture. However, contemporary research suggests that rather than having a fixed identity, ethnic people, especially the ethnic youth carry with them multiple identities, which they make use of in different ways. By considering this context, the primary objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the situation, expectations and concerns of Iranian youth and young adults (aged 14 â€“ 25) in the process of forming and retaining their Iranian identity in Australia.  In this study, 10 focused groups of between 8 to 10 individuals (aged 14-25) were studied. They were given the opportunity to express their opinions about various aspects of their situation and life in Australia.  Research findings indicate that Iranian youth living in Australia are not clones of their parents. Their life experience is different and their attitudes, values and behaviors are not the same. They are simply the products of a different generation and a different personal history. Whilst the Iranian youth have many similarities with mainstream Australian youth in their attitudes and aspirations, many differences exist between them. Furthermore, Iranian youth have many valuable assets, which deserve the recognition of the Australian government. They have the potential to become valuable cultural ambassadors in building and sustaining the bridge between two countries and most importantly between two cultures.
