All those involved in the analysis and application of Communication for Development and Social Change - or what can broadly be termed &quot;development communication&quot; - would probably agree that in essence communication for social change is the sharing of knowledge aimed at reaching a consensus for action that takes into account the interests, needs and capacities of all concerned. It is thus a social process. Communication media are important tools in achieving this process but their use is not an aim in itselfâ€”interpersonal communication too must play a fundamental role.  The basic consensus on development communication has been interpreted and applied in different ways throughout the past century. Both at theory and research levels, as well as at the levels of policy and planning-making and implementation, divergent perspectives are on offer (for comprehensive overviews, see Fraser &amp; Restrepo-Estrada, 1998; Lie, 2003; Servaes, 2001, 2003).  In this paper we attempt  (a) to summarize the past of Communication for Development and Social Change;  (b) to identify the roadmap for the future of Communication for Development and Social Change  (c) by looking at the key purposes, functions and competencies needed to steer communication for social change.  This attempt builds on earlier exercises hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Pan American Health Organization, and the Change Project of the US Agency for International Development in 2002.
