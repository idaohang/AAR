The lives of children are seen to be governed increasingly by child-focused legislation and policy. In this study we explored the different ways that children competently experience and deal with various forms of adult-determined regulation in their everyday lives.  We asked: What are childrenâ€™s everyday experiences?  How do they construct their own social spaces in everyday contexts?     We investigated childrenâ€™s experiences from the perspective of children themselves.  Studies of children using adult understandings of childrenâ€™s experiences are common, but few studies understand children as competent informants of their everyday lives.   In this study, we viewed children as active agents who deal competently with each other and with adults in their everyday lives.
