Since late 2002, the ICTpr website at http://cirac.qut.edu.au/ictpr/ is part of the ethnographic action research network in the initiative for â€˜ICTs and Poverty Reductionâ€™ supported by UNESCO. The site is a first step towards building key tools in the exchanges and communication between the lead researchers who conceptualise and guide the research process and the action researchers located at the different project sites. It is intended to optimise such exchange for rigorous and productive research.  The site is hosted by the Creative Industries Research and Applications Centre in Brisbane, Australia. It is used by a total of 37 members that include lead researchers, action researchers,  project coordinators and the team at UNESCO. Members access the site from: New Delhi, Kolkata, Baduria, Bangalore, Budikote, Chennai and other places in Tamil Nadu, Darjeeling, and Uttaranchal in India; Sitakund in Bangladesh; Tansen and Lumbini in Nepal, Jakar in Bhutan, Uva and other places in Sri Lanka; Brisbane in Australia; London in the UK.
