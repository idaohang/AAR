We must understand neoliberalism as a distinct form of government with political, economic and cultural components. In this paper, neoliberalism is defined in terms of the work of the Ordoliberalen and of the Chicago School. It is suggested that a definition of neoliberalism must dwell less the prioritisation of the market and the definition of all human activity in terms of economic criteria; it is more important to consider the degree of naturalness or artificiality of society, and the role of government in the generation and protection of society. It is suggested that as an economic practice, neoliberalism is not especially innovative, yet as a political practice, it is extremely inventive.
