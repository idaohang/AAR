Some 386,946  breach penalties were applied to welfare recipients by Centrelink during the 2000-2001 year, representing a trebling of breach penalties issued over the past few years.     Over its three terms, the Howard Coalition Government has sought to introduce practices under Mutual Obligation policy that increases surveillance, obligations and breach penalties which are brought to bear on unemployed people who are in receipt of income support payments. More recently, Government discussion papers have been released indicating the intent that other welfare recipients, including Disability Support Pensioners and Sole Parents, are to be included under these onerous Mutual Obligation processes.     With a view to foreshadowing some likely future outcomes for these latter groups, this paper compares the Howard Governmentâ€™s stated expectations for its Mutual Obligation policies and practices with the lived experience of a survey sample of 56 unemployed welfare beneficiaries. The 56 individuals had been breached by Centrelink in the Brisbane area, and voluntarily completed a questionnaire form provided by this researcher, on the footpath outside Centrelink offices at Mitchelton, Chermside and Nundah.
