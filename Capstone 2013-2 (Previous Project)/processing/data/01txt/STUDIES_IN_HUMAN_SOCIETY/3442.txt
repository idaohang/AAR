The purpose of this paper is to measure the costs of drug prohibition in Australia  and to examine the effects of prohibitionist drugs policy on the cannabis and heroin  markets. The key argument will be that prohibition, rather than being a hinderance  to the drugs black market, acts as an economic multiplier for the black market.  Prohibition is a subsidy for the corrupt.  This economic history was heavily influenced by Drugs, Crime &amp; Society, the Report  by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, hereafter  referred to as the Cleeland Report (after its Chairman Peter Cleeland MP) which  was the first government report to approach drugs as a commodity and to  understand the drug trade as a market.1 It was a wonderfully numerate report: the  first government report to estimate the size of drug markets, just as it was the first to  estimate the cost of drug law enforcement.  Because of their pioneering nature, Cleelandâ€™s estimations were often rudimentary,  back-of-the-envelope calculations, and later investigators, like Marks2 and Clement  and Daryal,3 have refined these estimates. This paper continues the tradition of  Cleeland revisionism, developing methods for calculating the value of the cannabis  market and for estimating the cost of drug law enforcement, over a 25 year period.  By comparing the value of the marijuana market and the cost of drug law  enforcement over this period, this paper argues that the value of the cannabis black  market has increased as a multiple of the cost of drug law enforcement.
