This paper discusses some issues in globalisation in mathematics education.  Using data from interviews conducted in Brazil2, we will attempt to achieve three  aims. Firstly, we aim to show the complexity of the issues surrounding what has  become a meta-paradigm of our late modern times, i.e. that of globalisation. Second,  we aim to illustrate some of the differing conceptualisations of globalisation that have  differing impacts on the discipline of mathematics education. Third, we aim to give  voice to mathematics educators not often heard on the Australian scape. Mathematics  eduction in Australia can be critiqued for being dominated by Anglo-European  concerns and theoretical stands.
