This article focuses on identifying how communities can better support parents, families and young people. Participants at an Effective Parenting Expo (n=57) were surveyed about the value of the event, the challenges facing them as parents, and the changes that would significantly improve life for their family. This paper focuses on responses to one open-ended question, &quot;Thinking of your community, what ONE change could be made to significantly improve life for your family?&quot; Responses were coded into three key categories: Improved Sense of Community, Increased Support for Families and Safer Communities. These responses clearly demonstrate the importance that parents place on having a safe, cohesive and friendly community in which to raise their children. Unfortunately, with social capital, community interactions and connectedness declining, the challenge is how to reverse this trend and foster a stronger sense of community. Participants identified several changes they believed would build better communities, believing that free community activities, meeting places and practical parenting courses would better connect them with families in their own community. This research highlights the importance of community for family well-being, with parents identifying changes they believe will significantly improve life in their community for their family.
