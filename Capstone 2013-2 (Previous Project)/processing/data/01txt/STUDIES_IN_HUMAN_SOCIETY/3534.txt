The intention of this project was to enhance the ability of graduates of Queensland University of Technology's (QUT) Bachelor of Social Science (Human Services) degree to address the complex, changing and diverse social care needs of service users and communities, and to better meet the professional practice standards and expectations of employers and professional bodies such as the Australian Institute of Welfare and Community Workers (AIWCW). It was envisaged that by using Human Service graduate outcomes and feedback, and industry input, to collaboratively develop relevant undergraduate and postgraduate curriculum, the quality of professional social care service delivery would be improved.  Methodology involved both qualitative and quantitative analysis from sources such as focus groups, industry forums and finally a questionnaire. Data analysis focused on identifying the degree of graduate satisfaction with course preparation; curriculum requirements to address graduate and industry needs and relationships between graduate outcomes and undergraduate curriculum.  The overall results of the questionnaire indicate that participants were mostly positive in their responses regarding the adequacy and relevancy of the undergraduate curriculum in preparing students for professional practice.
