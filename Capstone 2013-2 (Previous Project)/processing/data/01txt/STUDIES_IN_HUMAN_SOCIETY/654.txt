The question investigated by surveying mainstream Australians in Brisbane was whether studying Japanese floral art or a Chinese martial art changed their attitudes towards Asians or Asian culture. This was tested by an anonymous questionnaire with 44 questions. None of them began a course because of a special interest in Asia, yet eventually they learned about Asian culture and became interested in learning more. Several visited Asia after taking up their studies and the rest stated they now want to. While an attitude change could not be strongly demonstrated, a significant increase in knowledge about Asia, as well as an interest in Asian culture, was seen. Most were aware of anti-Asian attitudes in Australiaâ€™s past but few admitted such attitudes themselves, which may reflect the current view that such prejudice is not acceptable.
