This paper examines emergent issues of â€˜contextâ€™ raised by the application of information  and communication technologies for people with cognitive impairment.  The issue of the development and application of cognitive prostheses for this  group provides an opportunity to examine assumptions and issues emerging  from this area pertaining to understandings of the term 'context' in these applications.  In this sense the paper takes these assumptions and issues as a point of  departure for the development of a 'problematic' that can contribute to the  study of the experience of cognitive impairment. The paper specifically addresses  recent concerns about the lack of knowledge of these experiences in public spaces  such as shopping centres, given that this is a critical site for the civic participation  of this group. We argue that this participation should be understood in terms of  the 'meeting of two histories': the history of contemporary requirements governing  participation in public space and the habitus of people with cognitive impairment  with regard to this participation. The paper proposes that the salience of cognitive  impairment in these spaces turns on what it means for individuals to inhabit them  as complex 'Container Technologies' (Sofia) and underlines the importance of  understanding their efforts to attain a sense of normality (Goffman) in these contexts.  We propose that this approach can inform research contributing to the  development of a 'pattern language', informing applications that make cognition  a system property in networks that operate between humans, machines and their  contexts.
