This paper discusses the potential for using demographic and socioeconomic data projections to study geographical and temporal trends of community vulnerability to hazards. Several techniques are outlined, and their practical application critically discussed in relation to variables considered to be indicators of hazard vulnerability. Demographic projections for Southeast Queensland Local Government Areas were generated, mapped and discussed as an illustration of possible information outputs.
