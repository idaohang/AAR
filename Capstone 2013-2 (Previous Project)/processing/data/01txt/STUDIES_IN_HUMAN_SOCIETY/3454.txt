Doctor Ephraim McDowell is described in literature as &quot;The Father of Ovariotomy&quot; and  even, on occasion, as 'The Father of Abdominal Surgery' (see Ridenbaugh, 1890;  Schachner, 1921). Such titles indicate that McDowell could be considered as a 'great  man', a surgeon whose unique contribution to medicine can be described as a  definitive moment in the history of surgery. Without any intention of denying that  McDowell was, indeed, a brilliantly innovative surgeon, this paper will explore some of  the conditions of possibility that allowed one surgeon to emerge as a leader in his field.  McDowell was not the first to enter the abdomen of a patient, nor even the first to have  that patient survive. Yet his operation is recorded almost as the moment when modern  abdominal surgery began.  Using the archaeological approach of Foucault, it can be shown that certain conditions  of possibility allowed McDowell to assume his titles (Foucault, 1972). One cannot  present definitive answers to such riddles, but this paper will raise questions for  consideration. Questions that may cause us to reflect on the presentation of history  and to investigate in more detail how certain achievements are recorded. This work  will question whether Ephraim McDowell was born to be a 'great man' or was he  instead fortunate in the way history has described him.  Two operations will be illustrated here, that of Doctor Ephraim McDowell, carried out in  1809 and that of Doctor Robert Houstoun performed in 1701. After describing the  operations, details of the debate surrounding both procedures will be recounted. This  will be followed by a presentation of some of the conditions of possibility that may have  allowed McDowell to become so renowned. No definitive answers will be given here.  Rather, this work will encourage us to reflect on how some individuals attain historical  importance while others virtually disappear from our memory.
