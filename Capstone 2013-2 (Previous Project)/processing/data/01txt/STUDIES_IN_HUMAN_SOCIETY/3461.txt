The world is now characterised by extensive and rapid movements of people.  An increasingly important issue for industrialised countries, such as Australia, is  the rising number of people who are becoming displaced within their homelands  as a result of a multitude of interconnected factors. The majority of displaced  persons and refugees in our region are women and children. Yet, they are  severely underrepresented in refugee determination processes, claims for  asylum and settlement. This paper will examine womenâ€™s experiences of forced  migration and the neo-liberal global context in which they occur. Over the past  two decades the implementation of neoliberal policies in both the North and  South have not only resulted in colossal displacements, but have  simultaneously given rise to exclusionary politics. While globalisation conjures  up a vision of a borderless world, as a result of free flow of goods, our paper will  show that increasingly nation states have closed their borders to the displaced,  emphasising the distinction between 'economic' migrants and political refugees.  Based on recent fieldwork among internally displaced women and cross-border  forced migrants in South Asia, our paper will map out the ways in which the  aggressive pursuit of neo-liberal agendas and the rise of exclusionary politics,  based on national security and border protection, result in greater social  inequalities for women. By focusing on the ways in which women confront and  interpret the commonalities and differences of dislocation, our paper will  evaluate the contemporary applicability of the concept of &quot;refugee&quot; in  postcolonial states and highlight the significance of gendered displacements.
