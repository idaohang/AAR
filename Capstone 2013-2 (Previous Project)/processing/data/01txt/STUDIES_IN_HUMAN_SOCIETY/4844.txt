Recent research and educational policies have alerted teachers to the importance of  multiliteracies. Communication in society today is characterised by rapidly changing  and emergent forms of meaning-making in a context of increased cultural and linguistic  diversity. This paper responds to these imperatives, discussing key findings of a critical ethnography concerning interactions between pedagogy and access to multiliteracies among culturally and linguistically diverse learners. Data collection involved 18 days of lesson observations in a year six classroom over 10 weeks using field and journal notes, continuous audio-visual and audio recording, and the collection of cultural artefacts. Semi-structured interviewing was also conducted with the teacher, principal,and students. The data analytic tools included low and high inference coding and pragmatic horizon analysis. The findings concerned the use of critical framing â€“ an  important component of the multiliteracies pedagogy. The teacherâ€™s enactment of this  pedagogy had a significant influence on the learners' ability to access Claymation movie  designing. The conclusion addresses relevant literature concerning how to apply the  multiliteracies pedagogy to enable meaningful designing.
