While during the past twenty years working with young people has witnessed the rise of a movement involving young people in the planning and conduct of formal and genuine research activities, the methodology is still under-theorised and under-utilised. In a previous publication (Bland &amp; Atweh, 2003), we discussed some theoretical foundations for the involvement of students in meaningful educational research based on critical theory and its later developments in the writings of Habermas. In this paper, we will discuss in detail the question of â€œvoiceâ€¿ arising from collaborative projects with young people. We will refect on our experiences from one specific collaborative project with high school students that has been going on at the Queensland University of Technology for the past 12 years. The first section of the paper will provide the vision behind collaborative research projects with young people, concentrating on those conducted in educational settings. This will be followed by a short description of the Student Action Research for University Access (SARUA) project involving staff of the Faculty of Education and numerous high school students and their teachers in metropolitan Brisbane. The third section will problematise the question of â€œvoiceâ€¿ as we struggled with this concept in the planning and conduct of this project.
