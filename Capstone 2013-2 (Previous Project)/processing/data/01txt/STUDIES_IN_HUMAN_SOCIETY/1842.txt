This chapter explores the complex ways in which gender continues to influence the educational experiences and outcomes of both girls and boys.  While the specific focus of the chapter is on Australia, similar trends and debates have been seen elsewhere.  In the chapter I draw on socio-cultural and feminist perspectives to provide a framework for understanding the construction of gender relations in society, and the role of education in re-producing and changing gender inequalities.  I provide a brief overview of the history of gender reform in Australia, and discuss the implications of recent research concerning the differential educational achievements of girls and boys.  It is concluded that there is a need for gender equity initiatives to target both girls and boys, and in particular those girls and boys who are most disadvantaged through schooling.
