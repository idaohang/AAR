Per capita, Australia has the highest rate of greenhouse gas emissions in the  industrialised world (Turton &amp; Hamilton, 2002). As such, it is increasingly  recognised that engaging Australians in environmentally sustainable practices  and behaviours is central to reducing greenhouse gas emissions for a  sustainable future. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for engaging  people in environmentally sustainable everyday behaviours using interactive  Virtual Reality (VR). First, it provides a framework through which to understand  the elements necessary for the long-term uptake of environmentally sustainable  behaviours. It then considers how an active participatory engagement model is  suited to addressing these issues. Finally, it articulates the approach required by  facilitators as well as the role of VR in facilitating communication about  environmentally sustainable behaviour change between people in small group  settings.
