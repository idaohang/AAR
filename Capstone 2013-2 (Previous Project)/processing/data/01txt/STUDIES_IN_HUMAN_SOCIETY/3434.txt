Though economically-rationalist belief systems seem less invasive than they were in  the 1990s, market and quasi-market ideology is still being applied as a strategy for  improving the outcomes of welfare programs. The following discussion examines  remote Northern Territory (NT) Indigenous housing provision as a case study of the  potential irrationality of using quasi-markets within social intervention strategy. This  case study is a generalizeable example of ideology-based quasi-market provision.  Thus the discussion concludes by considering implications associated with private  sector participation in social intervention, and explores a better way to conceptualize  and deal with problematic policies.  The study incorporates a brief historical foray into the terminology and quasi-market  assumptions which underpin the logic of NT social intervention strategy. The  examination reflects on the nature of Indigenous living conditions; the intentions of  government intervention; the interpretation and logic of these intentions and the  consequent processes of intervention. It is assumed that such reflections are essential  to the formation of good policy and that insights into existing policy are possible if  this logical process is used. Thus the discussion commences with an examination of  Indigenous living conditions intervention in its historical context, and then it reflects  on the intentions of this intervention. It hinges on a re-examination of human need as  the focus of existing and future policy development.
