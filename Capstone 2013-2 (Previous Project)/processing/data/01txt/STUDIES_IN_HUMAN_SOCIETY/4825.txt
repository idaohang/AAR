This paper examines the way in which service agreements define relationships between government and community organizations. Service agreements are used for determining the contractual arrangements between government agencies and those organizations or agencies providing goods and services. There is considerable diversity in the ways in which governments use and write service agreements or contracts with community service organizations to deliver human services. The philosophies behind the use of these contracts differ, as do the frameworks developed to provide a set of principles and objectives for managing the relationship between government and community service providers. In addition, the funding mechanisms employed to achieve those objectives vary considerably from grants to competitive tendering models.
