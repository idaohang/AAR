Contemporary society is marked by speed. Within these alleged postmodern times many people live in a hyper-world of instant lifestyles, fast food, and snap decisions. Information and image are transferred at terminal velocities as symbolic capitalism transfers funds, futures, and options as well as advertising iconography over fibre optic cable or satellite communication systems. Identity and mobility have become intrinsically linked as advertising agencies exploit visions of global, contemporary nomadic travellers armed with Italian-designer business suits, palm pilots, mobile phones, and exotic aftershave. It is in this mobile and image-intense world that the elite motor sport known as Formula One (F1) resides. Formula One exists as a contradictory, paradoxical, and multifaceted entity. It is a hybrid of sport and business in which the most technologically advanced motor vehicles on the planet act as speeding billboards for international oil, telecommunications, or tobacco corporations. It is global, brash, noisy, consuming, polluting, chauvinistic, intense, and corporatised, it is, in effect, a mirror of many aspects of contemporary Western society. The sins of Western decadence broadcast to a near-global audience are reflected in Formula One.
