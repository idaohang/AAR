The principle of the childâ€™s best interests is said to be central to any work with children and their families. How practitioners define and enact this principle however, depends in large part on the kind of service they are providing. This paper reports research with practitioners in a Queensland childrenâ€™s contact service [CCS]. Workers were asked what the notion of the childâ€™s best interests meant for them and how they identified and acted in childrenâ€™s interests. The focus here is on three strategies or sets of practices they saw as essential: effectively engaging all service participants, facilitating positive parent-child interaction and encouraging childrenâ€™s participation in decision making. Some practitioners expressed dilemmas around working to promote childrenâ€™s interests while also achieving aims related to parents, in particular providing a neutral environment where parents could re-establish a sense of their identity as a parent. Such dilemmas imply consideration be given to models for the delivery of services for children whose parents are divorced or separated.
