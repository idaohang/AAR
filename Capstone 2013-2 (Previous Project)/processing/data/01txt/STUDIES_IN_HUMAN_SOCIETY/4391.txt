This is a set of thoughts about where Creative Industries has gone as a research and policy idea since its inception in 1997. I would like to thank and acknowledge all those people who are working in this area here at QUT and elsewhere in the city and broader, because I have certainly learnt a lot of what I am going to talk about today from them, and from the collaborative research and learning environment that we have got here.    I am going to talk a little about the origins, then talk about the idea of creative industries, its wide dissemination in different parts around the world and thirdly I am going to look at where the research and policy agenda is heading six years on from its inception.
