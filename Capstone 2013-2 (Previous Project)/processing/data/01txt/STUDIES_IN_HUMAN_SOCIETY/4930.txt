Informed choice is essential for the choice of superannuation fund objectives to be met, but significant barriers to informed choice presently exist. These barriers include an absence of relevant information disclosures by superannuation funds and the greater problem of members who are unable or are unwilling to exercise choice. While the first barrier could be overcome by establishing standardised measures of fund performance, the potential problem of large numbers of workers not exercising choice requires rethinking the default option. A possible solution is the establishment of a universal default fund.
