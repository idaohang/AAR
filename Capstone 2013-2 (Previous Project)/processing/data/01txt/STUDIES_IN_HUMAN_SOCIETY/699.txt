Despite recent events in the region and persistent threats of terrorism global mobility remains one the most obvious components of globalisation.  Yet how the social sciences should conceptualise global mobility continues to be contested.  This paper will review three models for understanding global mobility.  Although the first two models have formed the predominant conceptualisation of global mobility, it will be asserted that they are two abstract and theoretical to provide a comprehensive analysis.  Instead, a third approach, referred to in the text as the â€˜mundane approachâ€™, will be outlined, which examines the everyday processes and operations that enables global mobility.
