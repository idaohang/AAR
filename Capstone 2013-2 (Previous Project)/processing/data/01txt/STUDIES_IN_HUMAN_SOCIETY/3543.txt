Opposing views exist on nonprofit capacity. Some would argue the nonprofit sector acquits itself well in capacity terms, having lived long with the mantra of â€˜doing lots with littleâ€™. Light (2004, p.13) suggests â€˜nonprofits make miracles every dayâ€™ citing examples as diverse as rebuilding Europe after World War II to battling life threatening diseases like tuberculosis and polio. Pitted against this noble view are rumblings about high administration costs from an increasingly wary public (Independent Sector 2004, Baily and Bruce 1992) and trends toward more government and other regulation and watchdog activity (e.g. Reviews of charitable fundraising legislation around Australia and websites like Guidestar1 and Givewell2). Performance expectations are growing. As one example, â€˜change not charityâ€™ is an increasing catchcry from funding sources for nonprofit organisations (e.g. Reichstein Foundation3; Anheier and Leat 2002). This change agent role arguably demands even stronger capacity than that already required to meet charitable needs. Against this high demand backdrop, it is appropriate to ponder the state of Australiaâ€™s nonprofit capacity and how it might be strengthened in the future.  This paper provides a window into this topic, drawing on qualitative data that forms part of the year-long Giving Australia study (2005). Its main contribution is to explore what Australian nonprofit leaders perceive capacity building to entail along with their top of mind internal and external capacity concerns. A brief summary of views on capacity building from the literature begins the discussion to give context to this new Australian data from the coalface. The paper concludes with some of the paths forward to increased capacity indicated from participant feedback and adds some examples of what comparable sectors overseas are doing.
