Although there are many teaching styles in higher education, they can usually be reduced to two: the traditional, on campus attendance, lecturing, student-passive style and the newer, distance education, self-paced, student-active style. It is the contention of this paper, illustrated by two case studies of one Spanish and one Australian university, that the differences in technology seem to have evolved due to these different teaching styles. On the other hand, both institutions seem to be in the same stage of technological implementation, although the technological product appears different. A discussion is provided to consider the interaction effects in practice, teaching styles and institutional adoption stage on web based technologies in these two universities.
