Examines the competing, vexed debates about Aboriginal art and culture. In particular it examines the work of Eric Michaels on the issue of Aboriginal media. This paper argues that Michaels treats medium in a different manner in regard to indigenous electronic media than he does with indigenous art. It is actually the latter treatment, the issue of medium in art, that is more complex and more sustaining. The paper examines the significance of this approach to medium for dealing with the quandaries of immanence and difference in relation to Aboriginal culture as a whole.
