Intercultural business communication is becoming a common place in the modern world where business is conducted across the borders of countries. The research into intercultural business communication is also gaining increasing popularity amongst researchers in business communication, linguistics and social sciences. The purpose of this paper is to describe various strategies being used to establish solidarity amongst employees of a Japanese company operating in Australia. As Japanese people consider expressing and maintaining appropriate levels of politeness within their communication to be one of the most important aspects, I will use politeness as a key to analysing the solidarity amongst the employees. In addition, the unique nature of bilingual working environment, especially mixing of different languages within the same interaction, will be considered when making comparison with monolingual working environment
