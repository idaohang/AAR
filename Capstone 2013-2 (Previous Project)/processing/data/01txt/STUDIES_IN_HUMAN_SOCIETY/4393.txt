In Australia, broadcasting and communications have been historically a federal  responsibility, with the states playing a negligible role in broadcasting, and a minor  role in communications policy. But it is apparent, from international developments in  the creative industries, that government at other than national levels has in recent  years provided significant impetus to this sector.  An historic opportunity exists for the Queensland State Government to apply â€˜Smart  Stateâ€™ policy orientations and initiatives to jobs and growth, and to promote regional  development through community engagement in creative industries, beginning with  interventions in broadcasting and building strategic opportunities in content creation  more broadly.  The immediate context is the withdrawal of news services in North Queensland. This  sudden withdrawal highlights the broader and longer-term erosion of â€˜localismâ€™ in  Australian broadcasting.  When this is added to the uncertainties attending federal government policies on  digital broadcasting and broadband development, the nation - and particularly regional  and rural populations â€“ faces both short-term and longer-term crises in essential and  emerging communications amenities.
