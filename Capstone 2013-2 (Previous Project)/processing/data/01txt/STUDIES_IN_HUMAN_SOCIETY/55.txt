The department stores of the 19th century continue to fascinate social theorists.  This paper will expand on the work of two such theorists, Laermans and Featherstone.  Extending Laermansâ€™ and Featherstoneâ€™s analysis and applying the early work of Baudrillard, this paper will assert that through the manipulation of visual merchandising, the 19th-century department storeâ€™s managers constructed a world of sign consumption where goods were not only consumed for their use- or exchange- value but also were consumed as signs of luxury, exoticism, and excess.  By asserting that highly developed forms of sign-consumption existed in the 19th century, this paper challenges the view that symbolic consumption in spaces such as shopping malls is particular to the contemporary or postmodern age.
