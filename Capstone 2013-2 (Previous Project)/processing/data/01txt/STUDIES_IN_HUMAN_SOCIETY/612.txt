The development of information policy in Australia is reviewed from the introduction of planning documents in the 1980s through to recent progress. Emphasis is given to federal government and national initiatives and legislation. The reports of several committees of inquiry are considered, along with outcomes arising from them. It is concluded that many of the elements identified early in policy development are now being addressed, though integrated and compatible formulation of policy between different arms of government remains problematical.
