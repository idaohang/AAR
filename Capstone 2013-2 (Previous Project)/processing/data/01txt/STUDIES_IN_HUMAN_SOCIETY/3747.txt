This paper examines the utility of a spatial information tool in the form of a Geographic Information System (GIS)) in assisting human service agencies involved in integrated service approaches to engage in coordinated planning and service delivery initiatives. In accordance with an action research strategy, the aim of this study was to engage with stakeholders in the area of youth services and supports in a reflexive multidisciplinary environment regarding the potential of a spatial information tool in assisting integration and service delivery efforts. A number of maps depicting snapshots of demographic, disadvantage and housing data were produced, with the present paper reporting on stakeholdersâ€™ perceptions of both the mapped content and the potential of GIS in the development of a shared information system. Key issues relating to data collection, positioning in the information hierarchy and trust are discussed.
