Historically the Greeks have always travelled. Their foundation myths point to epic sea voyages of discovery, take for instance the travels of Odysseus or Jasonâ€™s voyage in the Argo in search of the Golden Fleece.1 Seafaring and venturing abroad became part of the Greek way of life, a normal way of settling excess population or providing opportunities for younger sons. From the earliest European contact Greek sailors and ship-owners visited Australia and carried home fantastic stories of the New World. The most infamous Greeks were seven pirates who had the temerity to attack a British warship in the Mediterranean and found themselves transported to New South Wales in 1829. Small numbers of Greeks arrived during the nineteenth century gold rushes, but, in general, they looked for steady business opportunities rather than speculative ventures.
