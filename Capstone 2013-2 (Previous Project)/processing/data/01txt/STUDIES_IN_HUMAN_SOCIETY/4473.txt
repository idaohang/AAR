The findings of the ACCC report, Emerging Market Structures in the Communications Sector, in June 2003 painted a bleak future for the Australian communications and media industries unless some major policy and regulatory changes are implemented. This report, along with the very important recommendations it made, is paralleled by a number of equally important contemporary issues regarding the future of these industries, such as telecommunications regulation and the issue of Telstra, the media ownership debate, the governmentâ€™s digital television policy framework and the future of the ABC. With the next federal election expected for mid-2004, the objective of this interview was to gain a broad outline of the alternative communications policy framework. In doing so, it captures the thoughts, the ALP perspective and the policy positions and priorities of the Shadow Minister for Communications, Lindsay Tanner MP, on the above issues.
