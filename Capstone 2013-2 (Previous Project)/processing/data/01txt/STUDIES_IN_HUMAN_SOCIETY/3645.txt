This essay attempts to provide a critical response to the recent essay by Elisabeth Porter concerning Australian refugee policy. Whilst it is acknowledged the current Australian Government stands condemned in many if not most aspects of foreign policy, it is suggested that there are a number of critical issues within the analysis by Elisabeth Porter which do require further attention, including, 1) the allegedly racist nature of Australian refugee policy, 2) the critique of mandatory detention, 3) the problem of secondary movers, and 4) the moral complexity of dealing justly and compassionately with asylum seekers. The writer agrees with Elisabeth Porter that the refugee problem is a global one, although it is concluded that it is precisely this global nature of the problem which means that local refugee solutions are not so simple, and that the enduring solutions ought to be regarded as global.
