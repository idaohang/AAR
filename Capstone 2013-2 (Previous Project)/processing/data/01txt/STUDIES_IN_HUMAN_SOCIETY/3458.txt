In the 1990s Emotional Intelligence (EI) emerged as a major phenomenon.  Today, its influence can be seen in Psychology, in Organisational Theory, and  in Human Resource Management. To date, most theoretical and empirical  work on the concept has taken place within the disciplines of Psychology and  Management. Remarkably, the disciplines of Cultural Studies and History  have remained relatively silent on the issue of EI.  This paper seeks to redress that imbalance. Using Bauman's work on liquid  modernity as a starting point, I seek to show how EI is a cultural construct of  the knowledge-based economies that characterise the present age of  globalisation. In this sense, EI can be seen as a postmodern advance  beyond that great construct of modernity: IQ. Certainly, EI is perfectly suitable  for a more democratised workplace, where hierarchies of power and  managerial control have given way to lateral networks and flattened  organisational structures. Considered as a cultural construct, the concept also  has much to tell us about the contemporary human subject as well as the  contemporary economy.  I shall argue, however, that the concept remains trapped between modernity  and postmodernity. This is because it retains many of the essentialist  assumptions of IQ, despite superficial appearances to the contrary. Lastly, I  shall argue that Cultural Studies and History have much to offer to those who  seek an understanding of the potential and the limitations of EI.  It should be noted, however, that although the terms modernity and  postmodernity might more commonly be used, and in fact could be used, I  shall use the terms 'solid modernity' and 'liquid modernity'. For reasons that I  hope shall become clear, these terms seem more evocative in the context of  the argument that I make.
