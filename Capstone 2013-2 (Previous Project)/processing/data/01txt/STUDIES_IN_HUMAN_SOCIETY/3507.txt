Organised and resourced sexual assault prevention efforts are no longer &quot;too  abstract and futuristic to serve as a practical basis for public policy&quot; (McCall, 1993,  p292).. While for some years there have been isolated activities for preventing  sexual assault or sexual violence, in 2004 the National Framework for Sexual  Assault Prevention was published by the Australian Office of the Status of Women.  In the same year, the Violence Abuse and Neglect Prevention team of NSCCH,  developed a local Sexual Assault Prevention Strategic Plan.  One model of sexual assault prevention uses public health strategies and social  marketing campaigns to reinforce the illegality of abusive behaviours. Carmody  warns, though, that &quot;[w]hile current prevention strategies continue to focus solely  on attempting to control or regulate unethical desire, acts and pleasure, they will  fail to achieve non-violent communities&quot; (Carmody, 2003, p213). The model of  sexual assault prevention proposed by the Sexual Assault Prevention Strategic  Plan includes the promotion of sexual health and ethical behaviours in  relationships.  This paper examines possible subject positions offered in differing violence  prevention models. It considers the nature of relationship with oneself and with  others that they suggest, and possible consequences of taking these up. The  paper is one component of a small study designed to examine young menâ€™s  experience of two different sexual assault prevention messages through public  poster campaigns. The study will contrast the effectiveness of these campaigns for  engaging young men in being responsible for their behaviours in relationships.
