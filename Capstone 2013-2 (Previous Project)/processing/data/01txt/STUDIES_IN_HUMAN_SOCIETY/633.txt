In the latter half of the 1950s, concerns that Australiaâ€™s teenagers, and especially working-class teenagers, were becoming delinquent reached a crescendo. Law-abiding citizens observed with concern bodgies and widgies congregating in milk bars and on street corners. Violence and sexual license were their hallmarks, they believed, with alarmist and sensationalist media reports having established and fuelled these understandings. Without recourse to reliable statistics, many people embraced the opinion that a substantial proportion of the countryâ€™s teenagers were uncontrollable. Some advocated punishments such as sending â€˜bodgies to the Nullarbor to work on a rail gangâ€™ (Perth Daily News, 7 October, 1957), sending them â€˜to sea under a tough [navy] skipperâ€™ (Perth Daily News, 16 November, 1957) and inflicting harsh corporal punishment upon them. Others, however, were more concerned about the adoption of preventative measures. Parental alcohol consumption and gambling, lack of discipline, high wages and youthful access to unsuitable comics, horror picture shows, and after 1956, rock and roll music were among the factors that generated delinquency, they suggested. Their views, popularized by sensational press reports, contributed to a â€˜moral panicâ€™ throughout the Australian community
