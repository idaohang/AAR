This paper examines of the notion of disenfranchised grief for donor-conceived adults. Robinson (2000) describes disenfranchised grief as grief which is:  not recognized and supported by the communityâ€¦. The mourners whose grief is disenfranchised are, by virtue of this, cut off from the social supports and so have few opportunities to express and resolve their feelingsâ€¦.either the relationship is not recognized, the loss is not recognized or the griever is not recognizedâ€¦Significant losses can occur even when the object of the loss it still alive (p. 127).  This paper argues that for a variety of reasons, which will be explored, such disenfranchisement is common for many donor-conceived adults. Those adults who grieve as a result of the intentional separation, and loss of nurturing and identity forming relationships with their biological relatives due to their donor conceptions. It is also proposed that though information and contact may become possible for a rare few donor-conceived adults (with their paternal family and siblings), there still are significant losses, which have been â€˜createdâ€™, and are most commonly disenfranchised.
