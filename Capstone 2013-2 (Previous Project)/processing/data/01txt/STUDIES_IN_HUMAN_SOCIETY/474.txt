For land-use planning purposes, Australian Local Governments select levels of flood risk or exposure they consider to be â€˜acceptableâ€™ for given land-uses. One example is the commonly applied 1-in-100- year design flood for residential land, which is a level chosen by local governments as acceptable for the community. However, Local Government is not the only stakeholder to make decisions regarding â€˜acceptableâ€™ flood risk. Within the planning and risk management frameworks for floodplain land-use, it is possible to identify two additional stakeholder groups who also participate in the decision-making process â€“ members of the development industry and the floodplain occupants. There has been little research to examine how the flood standards adopted as â€˜acceptable risksâ€™ by decision makers such as Local Government (and communicated via a technical language) are interpreted by other stakeholders, and whether the formal standards can be accurately labeled â€˜acceptable risksâ€™. This thesis aims to examine:   (1.) The perception of â€˜acceptableâ€™ risk by the stakeholders (Local Government, the floodplain occupants and the development industry);   and  (2.) The risk management context and land-use planning context of an urban floodplain (Guragunbah and the surrounding suburbs within the Nerang River Catchment, Gold Coast).
