When genealogies of oppression are revealed in their correct historical context they provide insights into the power relations of the day. Whether circumscribed by religious doctrine or political ideology, the â€˜oppressedâ€™ invariably align in some form for collective solidarity, national mobilization, empowerment activities or even revenge. The construct of these coalitions vary in terms of personnel, intensity of feeling, and mobility but their aims and focus are similar, that is, to defend against, or provide opposition to, an actual or imagined social force. The end goal of emancipation and empowerment, collective recognition and acceptance of reclaimed power by way of defensive, adaptive, or coping activities is the topic of this paper. But this â€˜recoveryâ€™ is dependent on how the collective cultural trauma of the oppressed is negotiated within the greater social, cultural, and political environment. The central theme of this paper deals with recovery strategies from cultural trauma and tentatively exposes this strategy as an insight as to why Indigenous Australians align with Islam in Australia.
