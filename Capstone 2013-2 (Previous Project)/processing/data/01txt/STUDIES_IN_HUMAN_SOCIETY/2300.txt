Current literature stresses the significance of networks and network theory in both social as well as technical domains. Not only is the role of networked technologies (such as mobile phones and the internet) in everyday life being scrutinized, but network theory is re-shaping an understanding of how social change and community interaction occurs. In this paper, I build on these developments to propose Network Action Research as a methodological variant of the action research family. I propose that Network Action Research is a timely and appropriate research methodology to guide studies that involve people, place and technology and to meet the challenges that stem from the changing nature of community interaction and social formations within a Network Society. I outline how technology can be used to operationalise and support Network Action Research. Examples from two case studies are used to illustrate key aspects of the methodology.
