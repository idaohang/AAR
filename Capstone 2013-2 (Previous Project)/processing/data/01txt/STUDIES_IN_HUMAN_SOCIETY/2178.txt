For researchers wanting to take up critical discourse analysis as an analytical tool, Norman Fairclough's (1989) early work provided a step-by-step approach that he called 'a guide not a blueprint.'   In response to calls for a more explicit theoretical justification, Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999) attempted to theoretically 'ground' CDA and to spell out its underpinning theories 'explicitly and systematically'.  Their recommendation for a 'shifting synthesis' of theoretical sources, however, has been criticised, raising significant questions about the extent to which this work is method-driven and theoretically-framed.   This paper explores some of the issues, considerations and advantages that surfaced as the author drew on a Faircloughian approach to CDA, its theory and method in researching literacy learning.
