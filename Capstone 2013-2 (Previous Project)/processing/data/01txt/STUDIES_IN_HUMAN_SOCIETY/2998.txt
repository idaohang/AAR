Concerns about social justice issues in mathematics education have a long history stemming from research on gender to issues related to ethnicity and social class. However, almost non-existent in this literature is a theoretical engagement with the concept of social justice itself. This paper further develops a model of social justice elaborated in previous presentations based on writings of feminist theoreticians. It posits social justice as a multidimensional and transcategorical construct. Further, it applies the model to a discussion of social justice in international collaborations in the discipline.
