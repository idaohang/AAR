Work in human service organisations is value laden and involves  transactions with people whose responses cannot be foreseen.  This contributes to the unpredictable and indeterminate nature of  practice. It is argued here that enacting values in this complex  context requires workers to deal with uncertainty and ambiguity. I  suggest that analysis of practice dilemmas is one way to support  practitioners in managing uncertainty and improving services. This  paper illustrates the utility of the notion of practice dilemmas via  analysis of the work of practitioners in children's contact centres. A  core value of practice in this setting, as in other settings where  children are clients, is that the child's best interests are paramount.  Analysis centres on how tensions involved in enacting this principle  allow us access to practitioners' thinking around how to provide  better direct services and to identify changes that may be  worthwhile at agency and systems levels.
