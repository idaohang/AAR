In tertiary institutions across Australia, good teaching increasingly means student centred and technological.  In this paper, this is demonstrated by a case study of Queensland University of Technology, where recent policy on teaching, promoted by management and supported by teaching and learning services, suggests two things. The first that it is impossible for QUT academics to educate their students without using inclusive and dialogical methods of instruction.  The second, that at QUT, effective use of technology is paramount to the success of such student centred learning.  This relationship, given legitimacy through the QUT focus on flexible delivery, raises larger questions about the dominant assumptions regarding â€˜good practiceâ€™ within the university setting.  In this context, the dominant assumption is the superiority of progressive education and this in itself assumes further a humanistic notion of the self.  This paper will suggest three things.  First that such assumptions should be challenged within tertiary teaching theory and practice, as they have been within the wider domain of social and cultural theory.  Second that the new valorised practices of progressive education actually depend upon old derogated practices, but that this reliance is either downplayed or disregarded.   Third, that the resulting unified policy on good teaching, needs rethinking.
