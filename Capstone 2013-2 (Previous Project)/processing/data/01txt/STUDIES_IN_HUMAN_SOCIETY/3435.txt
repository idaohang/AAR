Since 1996, the United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Racial  Discrimination has twice condemned Australiaâ€™s treatment of asylum seekers and  Aborigines. In 1998, the Coalition Government stopped paying benefits to  unemployed 16-18 year olds adversely affecting 46,000 people (Horin 1998).  Recipients of unemployment benefit were the first to feel the sting of the Howard  Governmentâ€™s increased breaching and mutual obligation regime which has  subsequently been extended to single parents and Disability Support Pensioners.  The Government has waged a relentless campaign to curb the power of the Federal  Arbitration Commission and the union movement. It is moving to weaken further the  bargaining power of workers. Private insurance has been promoted over public  programs: the undermining of Medicare and bulk billing are two obvious examples.  The Government has used the threat of terrorism to take away civil liberties and as  an excuse to invade other countries.  The purpose of this paper is simply to describe several of the social policy changes  installed by the Howard Government so as to provide a basis for understanding how  such changes have cumulatively eroded Australiansâ€™ sense of solidarity. It does not  attempt to locate such insights within a reified conceptual paradigm; rather it is  content to describe how such policies have impacted adversely upon long  established social, economic and political conceptions of citizenship. It will outline  preferable social policies and suggest ways in which these alternative policies might  be achieved.
