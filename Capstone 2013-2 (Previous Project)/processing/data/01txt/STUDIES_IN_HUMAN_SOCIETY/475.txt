The development of â€˜at-riskâ€™ urban flood plain and flood-affected environments continues to occur despite acknowledgement that there is a potential for flood impacts  (Handmer, 1995; Lambley, 1996; Smith, 1998; Granger et al, 1999, 2000, 2001).  For land-use planning the local government selects levels of flood risk or exposure they consider â€˜acceptableâ€™ (one example is the 1 in 100 year design flood for residential homes, which represents a minimum level of flood risk occupants should be exposed to).  However, local governments are not the only stakeholders in such decision-making â€“ other groups such as the development industry and residential/ commercial occupants also perceive and â€˜acceptâ€™ some level of flood risk when making decisions to develop and reside in the potentially flood-affected areas.      To date, there has been little research examining how other stakeholders (such as residential occupants and the development industry) perceive the formal levels of â€˜acceptableâ€™ flood risk adopted for land-use planning (such as the 1 in 100 year flood event for residential homes), and whether the actual risks associated with these levels can really be labelled as acceptable from the broader perspective of all stakeholders. This project aims to address these issues by examining the way in which a â€˜case studyâ€™ flood-affected urban area is managed by a local government and how â€˜acceptable riskâ€™ is perceived and expressed by the stakeholders (residential occupants and the development industry).  The Guragunbah flood-affected area and surrounding suburbs (within the Nerang River urban floodplain system) on the Gold Coast forms the case study for this project.  This paper will present an overview of the research in progress and preliminary areas of potential interest that have been drawn from the responses of a range of stakeholders.
