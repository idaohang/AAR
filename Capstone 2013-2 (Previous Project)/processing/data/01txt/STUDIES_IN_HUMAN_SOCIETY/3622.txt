Chris and Leesa are two Indigenous people who have come to mathematics education through their involvement in the struggle for Indigenous rights; Chris from being an Indigenous researcher with a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Leesa from a degree in Commerce and experience publishing material on Indigenous culture. Tom and Annette are two non-Indigenous people who have come to Indigenous culture through working in schools in Indigenous communities; both are mathematics educators and researchers. This paper attempts to describe the profound effect of Chris and Leesaâ€™s perspectives that mathematics education devalues Indigenous culture (see Matthews, 2003) on Tom and Annetteâ€™s Indigenous mathematics-education projects at QUT. It indicates the potential of partnerships to empower Indigenous research.   Note: The paper is written in heteroglossic form: Chris and Leesaâ€™s Indigenous perspectives are written in normal font; Tom and Annetteâ€™s reactions and reflections are written in italics.
