The sociology of childhood framework is generating new approaches to researching children as competent informants of their own everyday experience. Seeing children as competent research participants contrasts much educational research that sees children as developing and seeking to attain competence and provides valuable methodological insights of home and school. Participants were children aged 7-12 years enrolled in two Brisbane schools. This paper investigates children's own accounts of their everyday practices in two Brisbane schools. It provides accounts of how children, themselves, make sense of their everyday lives and how they feel about making decisions or having decisions made for them. The paper demonstrates that negotiating various forms of adult- etermined regulation and control is an important and necessary part of children's everyday lives. So too, it shows that some forms of adult regulation are more acceptable to children than others and that finding social spaces outside adult regulation is an important part of their everyday lives.
