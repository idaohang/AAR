Social network analysis offers the ability to firstly map a covert cell, and to secondly measure the specific structural and interactional criteria of such a cell. The method also endows the analyst the ability to measure the level of covertness and efficiency of the cell as a whole, and also the level of activity, ability to access others, and the level of control over a network each individual possesses. The measurement of these criteria allows specific counter-terrorism applications to be drawn, and assists in the assessment of the most effective methods of disrupting and neutralising a terrorist cell. This article will attempt to contribute to and advance the growing literature on social network analysis and terrorism studies through a social network analysis of the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo cell that produced the toxic nerve gas Sarin in Western Australia between early 1993 and late 1994. Through this application, this article will endeavour to provide research into terrorism in Australia, more specifically, understanding and explaining the operations and elements of the modus operandi of terrorist groups in Australia, an area which has received critically little attention.
