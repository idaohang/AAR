Investing in early childhood care and education services contributes to the lifetime well-being of children and families. Early childhood teachers work at the frontline of this investment, supporting families and dealing with day-to-day issues that impact on the lives and learning of young children. These teachers work within prevailing social and political structures yet they are also co-constructors of service provisions as they are experienced by families with young children. Nine teachers with work experience in a range of early childhood services engaged in conversations about key issues and contextual challenges facing their work as early childhood professionals. Three challenges raised by these teachers are examined to draw attention to the reality that creating a community of care for children and families requires re-thinking the role of the early childhood professional in service provision. This paper contributes to knowing about what it means to teach in contemporary early childhood contexts and to understanding how and why teachers find it difficult but necessary to actively promote connectedness and a sense of community across local services for children.
