The analysis considers social science knowledge, practice wisdom, human  motivation and the practice context in order to model both: professional  mastery within human-service change agents; and the processes involved in  developing the practice wisdom which makes mastery possible. The  discussion considers the practice context of the social/personal change agent  and considers their contextualized learning needs as potentially-wise early  practitioners. It examines contextualized competencies for human service  and reflects on the personal characteristics that are required of effective  change agents in mastering these competencies. The discussion argues that  competence, confidence and commitment are essential to the development of  contextualized practice wisdom and that essential processes, such as  reflective practice are best understood within this argument. Thus the  discussion promotes the development of core graduate capabilities, while  recognizing that these should include an active approach to developing  contextualized self-efficacy and deep understanding of personal motives  which relate to change agency. The discussion concludes that effective  professional change agents require a teaching and learning environment  which recognizes personal needs for development of not just competences,  but of personal confidence (self-efficacy) and a sense of control over  personal commitment levels which pertain to chosen aspects of change.
