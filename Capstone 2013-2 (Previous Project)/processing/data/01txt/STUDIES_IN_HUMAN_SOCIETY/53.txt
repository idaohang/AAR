Emerging from our experiences in the Northern Corridor Education Precinct (NCEP) is a developing conceptual framework that the authors have labeled as Transient Communities of Engagement (TCE) our three-leafed clover. This refers to the nature of the complex relationships between individuals, groups and communities within the wider community.  With respect to the evolution and sustained development of the NCEP, it is the understanding and management of our TCE that allows trust, support and open communication to emerge, develop and grow within the initiative    Understanding TCE integration has allowed managed sustained growth using the grassroots support, resources and skills within our geographic area.  But more, it has allowed both a conceptual model and now a physical model to emerge showing how multidimensional social and organisational systems can be understood, explained, implemented and operationalised for the benefit of the constituent yet transient communities they serve.    This paper looks at how TCE integration has been applied within the Deception Bay Life Long Learning Project through community participation involving a Community Jobs Plan project from the Department of Employment and Training. The project is designed to facilitate a Life Long Learning initiative through the local community and involving the provision of traineeships to eight members of the community receiving both vocational education and work experience as Stage 1 of the program.  In addition, to identifying learning needs for the community it is creating an environment in which a viable and sustainable learning continuum can emerge.
