Although many Australian children change schools during the course of a school year, the children of itinerant seasonal farm workers can move residences as well as schools on a regular basis, often two or three times annually.  Surprisingly, however, educational itinerancy has not been widely researched, particularly in Australian contexts.  This paper uses a case study approach to discuss some of the issues that affect the literacy learning of the children from one family, who follow summer and winter harvesting seasons across state borders.  Through this approach, the voices of the children and their families are heard alongside those of their teachers and other school personnel.
