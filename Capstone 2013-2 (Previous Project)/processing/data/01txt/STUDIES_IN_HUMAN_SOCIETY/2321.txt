Gambling is now a large revenue source for many governments due to its ease of implementation, popular appeal and the high real tax rate it can bear (up to 40%). It is often promoted by spending on 'good causes' designated as additional to existing government activity. This article examines the UK's National Lottery and Electronic Gaming Machines (EGMs) in Queensland Australia and shows that, in both cases, gambling taxes are often diverted into education, health and social and economic development and therefore substitute for taxation raised elsewhere in the economy. In addition, there is evidence that gambling's taxation implications (against income) are doubly regressive, taking disproportionately from lower income groups and giving to those better off.
