Researchers observing associations between age and political attitudes have  frequently puzzled over what such relationships mean. Do they reflect aging or  political maturation processes that occur over the life cycle or do they reflect  differences between age cohorts or political generations? Cross-sectional  sample survey data, the most common form of evidence available, is  notoriously impotent in the face of such questions, since for the most part any  observed correlation between age and political attitudes could be consistent  with either explanation. Ideally, what is needed to address the issue  appropriately is longitudinal panel data, in which the same individuals are  monitored over a substantial period of time. Panel studies, however, are not  only extremely rare but seldom run for the length of time required to allow for  robust monitoring of age-related changes. In a less than ideal world, an  alternative data source is repeated cross-section studies spread out over a  significant period. This paper employs six cross-sectional surveys, collected  over a decade and a half in an attempt to untangle life cycle and generational  effects on political attitudes.
