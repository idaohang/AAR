Terrorism influences the lives of many Australians. A concept that was once discussed primarily by the academic and intelligence communities now saturates popular culture. Some view this as an odd phenomenon as a significant act of terrorism has never occurred in Australia. The attacks in New York, Bali, Madrid, and London have created a culture of fear in these regions. Australians do not share these feelings as what many believe to be fear is not rationalised in the same way. The likelihood of terrorism in Australia has become secondary to the impact of the threat of terrorism. This is particularly so when attending work. In New York, Madrid and London the employed community were not incidental victims; they were targets by design. In this paper, preliminary results of qualitative research conducted in organisations in inner city Melbourne is presented. I conclude that Australians do not fear terrorism but dread its occurrence. Despite there being no specific terrorist threat to Australia many people perceive a threat that significantly affects their lives especially when at work. These affects include significant discrimination at work, increasing occupational stress and changing organisational culture.
