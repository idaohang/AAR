This paper reports on a focus group study into teacher professional identity conducted in Queensland, Australia. It examines the images of teachers and children, the imagined worlds of schools and classrooms, and some possibilities for imagining new professional identities that arose in the focus group talk of teachers.  The authors suggest that the emergence of new pedagogic practices, namely â€˜no touchâ€™ pedagogies, inculcate new cultural dispositions in teachers: heightened anxiety about touching children (Jones, 2001); professional collegiality via safety in numbers (McWilliam &amp; Singh, 2003), and 'awareness' of inherent paradoxes between safe, non-risky and productive pedagogies (Jones, under review).
