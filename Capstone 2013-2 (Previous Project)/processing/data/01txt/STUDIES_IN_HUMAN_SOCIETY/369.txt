Here I argue that, given the ever-increasing international collaborations and widening phenomena of globalisations (Atweh &amp; Clarkson, 2001) of many areas in mathematics education, it is essential that these programs are critically reflected upon and are put under the critical gaze of research. Further, they should be analysed in conjunction with the views, expectations and values of the local mathematics educators if such collaborations are to avoid becoming another form of cultural imperialism that do not contribute to the capacity building of the recipient countries.   This paper discusses findings of the conduct of a study in the Philippines during the early months of 2003. It discusses some views and reflections by a group of leading mathematics educators in the Philippines about the patterns and effects of international and global activities in mathematics education in their country. It also discusses two types of international collaborations between the Philippines and overseas countries. It is not the intention here to evaluate the two projects, but to use them to raise some questions for further research.
