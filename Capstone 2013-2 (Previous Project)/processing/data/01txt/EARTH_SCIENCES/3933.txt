Synthetic corundum (Al2O3), gibbsite (Al(OH)3), bayerite (Al(OH)3), boehmite (AlO(OH)) and pseudoboehmite (AlO(OH)) have been studied by high resolution XPS. The chemical compositions based on the XPS survey scans were in good agreement with the expected composition. High resolution Al 2p scans showed no significant changes in binding energy, with all values between 73.9 and 74.4 eV. Only bayerite showed two transitions, associated with the presence of amorphous material in the sample. More information about the chemical and crystallographic environment was obtained from the O 1s high resolution spectra. Here a clear distinction could be made between oxygen in the crystal structure, hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water. Oxygen in the crystal structure was characterised by a binding energy of about 530.6 eV in all minerals. Hydroxyl groups, either present in the crystal structure or on the surface exhibited binding energies around 531.9 eV, while water on the surface showed binding energies around 533.0 eV. A distinction could be made between boehmite and pseudoboehmite based on the slightly lower ratio of oxygen to hydroxyl groups and water in pseudoboehmite.
