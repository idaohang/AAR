This paper focuses on some important GPR pre-processing   tasks.  These tasks are necessary to improve formal target   detection  and  estimation  stages.    Evaluations  performed   using  a  conventional  matched  filter  on  real  GPR  data   demonstrate  the  benefits  of  pre-processing. This  effort  is   conducted  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  realising  a  reliable   GPR-based coal-thickness sensor.
