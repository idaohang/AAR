Particle emissions from twelve buses, aged 1 to 19 years, operating alternatively on low sulphur (LS; 500 ppm) and ultra-low sulphur (ULS; 50 ppm) diesel fuel were monitored at four steady-state operating modes on a chassis dynamometer. The mean particle number emission rate using ULS diesel was lower than the rate using LS diesel in each of the four modes. The fractional reduction was highest in the newest buses and decreased with mileage up to about 500,000 km, at which stage a bus was about 8 years old. No further decrease was apparent as the mileage increased thereafter. However, the mean total suspended particle (TSP) mass emission rate did not show a systematic difference between the two fuel types. When the fuel was changed from LS to ULS diesel, the reduction in particle number was mainly in the nanoparticle size range, with occurrences of the nuclei mode being significantly restricted. Overall, 58% of the particles were smaller than 50 nm with LS fuel as opposed to just 45% with ULS fuel, suggesting that sulphur in diesel fuel was playing a major role in the formation of nanoparticles. The greatest influence of the fuel sulphur level was observed at the highest engine load, where 74% of the particles were smaller than 50 nm with LS diesel compared to 43% with ULS diesel.
