While various sampling methods exist for collecting and enumerating airborne bacteria and fungi, no credible methodology has yet been developed for airborne viruses. A new sampling method for monitoring the personal exposure to bioaerosol particles has recently been developed and evaluated with bacteria and fungi. In this method, bacterial/fungal aerosol is aspirated and transported through a porous medium, which is submerged into a liquid layer. As the air is split into numerous bubbles, the particles are scavenged by these bubbles and effectively removed. The current feasibility study was initiated to evaluate the efficiency of the new personal sampler prototype (&quot;bubbler&quot;) with airborne viable viruses. Two common viral strains, Influenza (stress-sensitive) and Vaccinia (robust), were aerosolized in the test chamber and collected by two identical &quot;bubblers&quot; that operated simultaneously for a duration of upto 5 min. A virus maintenance liquid, proven to be the optimum collecting environment for the test organisms, was used as a collection fluid. After sampling, the collecting fluid was analyzed and the viral recovery rate was determined. The overall recovery (affected not only by the sampling but also by the aerosolization and the aerosol transport) was 20% for Influenza virus and 89% for Vaccinia virus. The new sampling method was found feasible for the collection and enumeration of robust airborne viruses.
