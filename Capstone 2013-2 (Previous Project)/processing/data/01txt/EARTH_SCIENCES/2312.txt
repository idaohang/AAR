There has been little research to examine how the flood standards adopted as â€˜acceptable risksâ€™ by decision makers such as local government (and communicated via a technical language) are interpreted by other stakeholders, and whether the formal standards can be accurately labelled â€˜acceptable risksâ€™. This paper presents a study,  based on a Queensland local government area â€“ the Gold Coast City Council (GCCC), examining the flood risks perceived â€˜acceptableâ€™ by the stakeholders. These stakeholders include local government, the residents and the development industry within a potentially flood-affected urban area of Guragunbah and the surrounding suburbs within the Nerang River catchment.
