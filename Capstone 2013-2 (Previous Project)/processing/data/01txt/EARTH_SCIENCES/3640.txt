This paper represents an overview of the spectroscopic studies of both synthetic and naturally occurring beidellites performed as part of my research over the past 16 years. It shows that detailed information on the local structure of beidellite and changes in this local structure upon heating can be obtained by combining a range of spectroscopic techniques such as mid-infrared, near-infrared, infrared emission, Raman, nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
