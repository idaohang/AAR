Intensity of the fluorescent signals detected by the UVAPS was found to be directly proportional to the amount of the fluorophores in the airborne particles, which indicates that the UVAPS data can be used to estimate the number of individual microorganisms in the particles. This study further explored a capability of the UVAPS to provide data on the concentration of airborne bacterial cells, in addition to the concentration of airborne bacterial particles.
