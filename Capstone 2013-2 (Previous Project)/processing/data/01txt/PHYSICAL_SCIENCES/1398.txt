The finite-difference time-domain method is employed for the analysis of coupling of the surface modes of two truncated one-dimensional photonic crystals separated by a gap. Wavevector, field distributions and existence conditions of the coupled surface modes are investigated. The wavevector of symmetric gap modes increases with decreasing gap width, while that of antisymmetric modes decreases - exactly opposite to the situation for surface plasmons on metallic half-spaces separated by a dielectric gap. Photonic crystal gap modes could be easily used as effectively non-dissipating gap mode waveguides.
