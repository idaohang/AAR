Epidemiological evidence and in vitro data suggest that COX-2 is a key regulator of accelerated remodeling. Accelerated states of osteoblast and osteoclast activity are regulated by prostaglandins in vitro, but experimental evidence for specific roles of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) in bone adaptive remodeling in vivo is lacking. We found that treatment with a specific COX-2 or sPLA2 (group IIa) inhibitor prevented ovariectomy-induced (OVX-induced) decreases in trabecular connectivity; suppressed the acceleration of bone resorption; and maintained bone turnover at SHAM levels following OVX in the rat. The sPLA2 inhibitor significantly suppressed increases in osteoclast surface induced by OVX, whilst the COX-2 inhibitor only had a marginal effect. These findings demonstrate that specific inhibitors of COX-2 and sPLA2-IIa effectively suppress OVX-induced bone loss in the adult rat by conserving trabecular bone mass and architecture through reduced bone remodeling and decreased resorptive activity. Moreover we report an important role of sPLA2-IIa in osteoclastogenesis independent of the COX-2 metabolic pathway in the OVX rat in vivo.
