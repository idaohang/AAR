This paper presents the Australian BioGrid Portal that aims to provide the biotechnology sector in Australia with ready access to technologies that enable them to perform drug-lead exploration in an efficient and inexpensive manner on national and international computing Grids. Access will be provided to docking applications and a wide variety of chemical databases. In addition, analysis of the screening results will be made possible using web-based tools, along with archival of these results.  The portal aims to become a complete molecular docking e-Research platform, from user management, through to experiment composition, execution over grid resources, and results visualization. One of the most sought after functionalities in the Grid Portals today is â€˜Persistenceâ€™ and this paper presents a solution which not only offers persistence but also provides portability across the other JSR168 compliant portal containers.  This portal also offers a mechanism for users to easily manage multiple projects.
