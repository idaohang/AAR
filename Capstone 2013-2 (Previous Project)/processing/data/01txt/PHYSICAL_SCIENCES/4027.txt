The stoichiometry of Ge/Si islands grown on Sis111d substrates at temperatures ranging from 460 to 560 degrees Celsius was investigated by x-ray photoemission electron microscopy sXPEEMd. By developing a specific analytical framework, quantitative information on the surface Ge/Si stoichiometry was extracted from laterally resolved XPEEM Si 2p and Ge 3d spectra, exploiting the chemical sensitivity of the technique. Our data show the existence of a correlation between the base area of the self-assembled islands and their average surface Si content: the larger the lateral dimensions of the 3D structures, the higher their relative Si concentration. The deposition temperature determines the characteristics of this relation, pointing to the thermal activation of  kinetic diffusion processes.
