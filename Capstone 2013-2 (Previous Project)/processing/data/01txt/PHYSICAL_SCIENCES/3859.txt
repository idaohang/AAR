The microstructure, thermal stability, surface energy and swelling characteristics of two kinds of commercial organoclays, before and after washing treatment with a mixture of H2O/ethanol, were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG), wettability measurement and swelling measurement. This study demonstrates that the external-surface physically adsorbed surfactant can be removed after washing treatment, resulting in an increase in thermal stability and a decrease in surface energy of the resultant organoclays. Organoclays are difficult to be introduced into a solvent when their surface energies are lower than that of the solvent. On the other hand, the organoclay with Î³organoclay &lt; Î³solvent is easier to be swollen and expandable by the solvent. The swelling and basal spacing measurements of the organoclays introduced into organic media indicate that the swelling factor and the interlayer swelling are two independent parameters. Both the polar character of the solvent and the swelling capacity of clay have a prominent effect on the interlayer swelling of the organoclays.
