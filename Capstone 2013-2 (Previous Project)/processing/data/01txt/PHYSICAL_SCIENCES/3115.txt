We report numerical analysis and experimental observation of two-dimensionally localized plasmonic modes guided by a nano-gap in a thin metal film. Dispersion, dissipation and field structure of these modes are analyzed using the finite-difference time-domain algorithm. The experimental observation is conducted by the end-fire excitation of the proposed gap plasmon waveguides and detection of the generated modes using their edge scattering and CCD camera imaging. Physical interpretation of the obtained results is presented and origins of the described modes are discussed.
