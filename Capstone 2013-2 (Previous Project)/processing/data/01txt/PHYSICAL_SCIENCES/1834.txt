An efficient compact-2D finite-difference time-domain method is presented for the numerical analysis of guided modes in waveguides that may include negative dielectric permittivity, negative magnetic permeability and negative refractive index materials. Both complex variable and real variable methods are given. The method is demonstrated for the analysis of channel-plasmon-polariton guided modes in triangular groves on a metal surface. The presented method can be used for a range of waveguide problems that were previously unsolvable analytically, due to complex geometries, or numerically, due to computational requirements of conventional three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain methods. A 3-dimensional finite-difference time-domain algorithm that also allows analysis in the presence of bound or free electric and equivalent magnetic charges is presented and an example negative refraction demonstrates the method.
