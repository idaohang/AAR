We demonstrate that single-mode operation of a sub-wavelength plasmonic waveguide in the form of a V-groove on a metal surface can be achieved by adjusting depth of the groove. Strongly localized channel plasmon-polaritons (CPPs) are shown to propagate in such waveguides. If the groove depth is close to the penetration depth of the fundamental CPP mode, then all higher modes are not supported by the structure, leaving only the fundamental mode propagating in the groove. In this case, propagation distances of fundamental mode ~ 10 micron can easily be achieved together with strong sub-wavelength localization.
