More than half of the land area used for cropping in Australia is affected by sodicity.  In most of these soils, the yield is restricted to less than 50 per cent of the potential yield determined by the climate.  As a result, there is a widespread net production loss which is believed to cost several million dollars each year. As irrigation water is becoming increasingly limited in Australia, it is vital to improve the water use efficiency of crops grown under irrigated conditions.  Using PAM in sodic soils has potential not only to improve crop production, but also to minimise environmental impacts such as soil erosion and turbidity of water.
