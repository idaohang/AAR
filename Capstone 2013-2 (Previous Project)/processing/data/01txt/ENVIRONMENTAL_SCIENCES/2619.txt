Average rice yields in the Western Murray Valley of NSW were consistently about 1 t ha-1 lower than that of the Eastern Murray Valley of NSW.  This was attributed to a greater incidence of turbid water, which reduces soil temperature and sunlight penetration thus contributing to poor seedling establishment.  G is used to improve soil structure and minimise dispersion in sodic soil.  However, higher rates of G increase infiltration rates and therefore water use to undesirable levels in rice bays (Humphreys and Barrs 1998).  Cay, Sivapalan and Chan (2001) found that anionic PAM was most effective at reducing turbidity of water compared to cationic and non-ionic PAM.  They also concluded that the rate of 5 kg PAM ha-1 was not significantly different than 10 kg PAM ha-1 for reducing turbidity.  Previous work has shown that PAM efficacy has been improved through combination with G (Shainberg et al 1990; Zahow and Amrhein 1992; Rapp et al 2000).  Therefore, the following laboratory experiments were undertaken to identify the rates of PAM, G and their combinations to reduce the turbidity of water without increasing water use through greater infiltration on a sodic soil.
