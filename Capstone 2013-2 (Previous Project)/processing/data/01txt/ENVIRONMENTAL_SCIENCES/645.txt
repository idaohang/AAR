Minimising the impact of domestic housing on the environment is an important focus for planners and designers of sustainable homes, however little is known about how consumers interact with and view sustainable housing design. With research indicating consumer reluctance towards the uptake of sustainable or &quot;smart housing&quot;, this project was designed to monitor the day-to-day experiences of living in a Smart House. Research House in Rockhampton, Queensland has been a living laboratory over two years (2002-2004), called &quot;home&quot; by two adults. They shared their experiences of living in a smart house, interacting daily with sustainable housing design. This paper investigates the functional aspects of adaptation to living in smart housing. The focus is on resident's satisfaction with the design and physical layout of the house, specifically the surface design, airflow, natural lighting, access, security and spaciousness. Findings from this study contribute to evaluations of the impact of eco-friendly housing, providing consumer feedback and perceptions of smart house design after prolonged firsthand experience.
