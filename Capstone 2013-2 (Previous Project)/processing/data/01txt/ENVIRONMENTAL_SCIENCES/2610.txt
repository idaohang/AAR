High water turbidity levels affect the successful establishment of rice seedlings. A range of anionic polyacrylamides (PAM) were tested for their effect on turbidity, infiltration, germination and crop growth. Different PAM products had varying ability to reduce water turbidity. PAM at the rate of 5 kg/ha combined with gypsum at the rate of 25 kg/ha reduced turbidity below threshold levels. PAM used alone or with gypsum did not have any significant effect on infiltration through the treated soils. On the other hand, these treatments had a positive effect on the germination of soybean seeds. Plant growth rate was also improved by these treatments.
