High turbidity in water in sodic soils has been found to contribute to poor seedling establishment for rice crops within the Western Murray Valley (WMV) of New South Wales, Australia.  Polyacrylamides (PAM) were tested for their effectiveness in reducing the turbidity as an alternative to, and in conjunction with gypsum.  Six high molecular weight PAM products representing anionic, cationic and non-ionic charges were tested in the laboratory both individually and in combination with analytical grade gypsum to determine their ability to reduce dispersion of a highly sodic soil (ESP&gt;15) collected from the Wakool area in the WMV.  The rates of application of PAM were 5 and 10 kg.ha-1 while the rates of gypsum represented 0.6, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 t.ha-1 of natural gypsum.  100 g of soil was placed in a 400 ml jar and flooded with solution using two different application methods.  Dispersion was determined using a turbidimeter and measured in nephelometric turbidity units (NTU).  Turbidity reduction was most effective in anionic PAM followed by cationic and non-ionic.  A split application of 10 kg.ha-1 for the high density anionic charge PAM was the most successful straight treatment, reducing turbidity by 82.6% relative to its control.  All PAM/gypsum combinations reduced turbidity by more than 99.7% relative to the control.
