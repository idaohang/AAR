This paper describes collaborative research commenced early in 1998 and being pursued in cooperation with the Queensland Government. It extends prior work by Hirschheim, R. and Lacity, M. (Beyond the information systems outsourcing bandwagon: the insourcing response, 1995; Information systems outsourcing: myths, metaphors and realities, J. Wiley, Chichester 1993) in the private sector, identifying government specific contingencies, with emphasis on the outsourcing relationship and related contract structures. Comparison will be possible between the prior study and findings in the public sector. Preliminary findings will be available for presentation at ACIS'98.
