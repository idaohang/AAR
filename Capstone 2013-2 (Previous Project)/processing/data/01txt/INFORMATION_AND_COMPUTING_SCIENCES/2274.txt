Increasing amount of illicit image data transmitted via the internet has triggered the need to develop effective image  mining systems for digital forensics purposes. This paper discusses the requirements of digital image forensics which underpin  the design of our forensic image mining system. This system can be trained by a hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) to  detect objects and scenes which are made up of components under spatial or non-spatial constraints. Forensic investigators can  communicate with the system via a grammar which allows object description for training, searching, querying and relevance  feedback. In addition, we propose to use a Bayesian networks approach to deal with information uncertainties which are inherent  in forensic work. These inference networks will be constructed to model probability interactions between beliefs, adapt to  different usersâ€™ retrieval patterns, and mimic human judgement of semantic content of image patches. An analysis of the  performance of the first prototype of the system is also provided.
