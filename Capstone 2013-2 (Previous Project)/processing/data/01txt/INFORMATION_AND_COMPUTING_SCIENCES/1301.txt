The Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is committed to ensuring that its students are not only discipline savvy but also skilled in generic capabilities.  To facilitate the development of generic capa-bilities within its educational programs QUT has supported a project, which involved the creation of a web based tool known as the Student Capability Profile (SCP).  The SCP aims to be a dynamic and flexible vehicle for documenting individual studentâ€™s personal development and growth within the broad spectrum of workplace skills. The SCP will be an invaluable tool, especially in the recruitment process, as it will allow students to inform potential employers of their achievement and growth within generic capabilities.  This paper will explore a case study of how the system is being used in teaching generic capabilities such as teamwork and communication skills within library and information studies.  The pa-per discusses the practical implications of using technology to facilitate student development of generic capabilities and how it impacts on the teaching and learning process.
