The rapid growth of multimedia technology has resulted in an enormous amount of data that needs to be managed and indexed efficiently to provide effective labeling for an image indexing system requires all objects in the image to be identified. To perform better and effective object identification, the process needs to be performed automatically and without priori knowledge of the image content. This paper presents an approach in automatic object identification scheme, by analysing the image structural information. The image is segmented using image automatic segmentation techniques and components of objects are obtained by grouping the segments together. In this paper, we present the issues and problems involved in providing such identification scheme. Some experiment results will be presented.
