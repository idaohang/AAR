We present new cryptanalysis of the Telecommunications hash algorithm known as Cellular Authentication and Voice Encryption Algorithm (CAVE). The previous guess-and-determine style reconstruction attack requires $2^{91}$ (resp. $2^{93}$) evaluations of CAVE-4 (resp. CAVE-8) to find a single valid pre-image (one which satisfies the input redundancy). Here we present a new attack that finds emph{all} valid pre-images with effort equivalent to around $2^{72}$ evaluations of the algorithm for both CAVE-4 and CAVE-8.
