University administrators urge their staff to focus on &quot;student as client&quot;, flexible delivery and working in partnership across organisational boundaries. The Course Materials Database project at QUT aims to provide coursework students with access to the majority of their high use information resources in digital form. This includes copyright materials, QUT course/lecture notes and past exam papers. When the student logs into their own Personal Profile(Portal) on QUT Virtual (the QUT Intranet), they will link through to all their enrolled unit/subject Web pages. Each unit Web page will provide links to the digitised course notes, articles and past exam papers for that subject. This service will integrate information resources with courseware, conveniently arranged for the student in one place.    Three factors enable the project: the recent agreement between the Copyright Agency Limited (CAL) and Australian universities to allow the digitising of reasonable portions of copyright materials under statutory licence for an agreed fee, the development of the Student Personal Profile on QUT Virtual, and QUTâ€™s standardisation of online teaching pages.    The project is the result of collaboration between several areas of QUT: academics, the Library, Teaching and Learning Support Services, Publications and Printery, Information Technology Services, Student Copying and Printing, and the Copyright Officer.
