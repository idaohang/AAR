Research on process flexibility has traditionally explored alternative ways of considering flexibility during the design of a business process. The focus typically has been on ways of how the demand for process flexibility can be satisfied by advanced process modeling techniques, i.e., issues intrinsic to the process. This paper proposes to extent current research by studying the extrinsic drivers for flexibility. These drivers can be found in the context of the process, which may include among others time, location, legislation, culture, performance requirements etc. Exemplary scenarios for such extrinsic flexibility drivers will be discussed and preliminary thoughts on context-aware process design approaches will be shared. The paper ends with a proposed research agenda in this area.
