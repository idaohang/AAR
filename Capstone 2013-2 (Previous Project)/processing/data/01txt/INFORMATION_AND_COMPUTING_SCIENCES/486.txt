Competitive co-evolution has been successfully applied to breed artificial players. The fitness of players is evaluated through competition with other players. The estimation of  the fitness (rating) of players is the computational bottleneck of this approach. It is therefore desirable to exploit as best as possible the information contained in the outcomes of played games. In this paper, we introduce an efficient induction method of player ratings from tournament results. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed formula gives more accurate results than the estimation formula that is traditionally  used.
