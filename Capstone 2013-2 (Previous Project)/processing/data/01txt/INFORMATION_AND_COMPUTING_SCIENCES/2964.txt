Kernel methods such as kernel principal component analysis  and support vector machines have become powerful  tools for pattern recognition and computer vision. Unfortunately  the high computational cost of kernel methods is a  limiting factor for real-time classification tasks when running  on the CPU of a standard PC. Over the last few years,  commodity Graphics Processing Units (GPU) have evolved  from fixed graphics pipeline processors into more flexible  and powerful data-parallel processors. These stream  processors are capable of sustaining computation rates of  greater than ten times that of a single CPU. GPUs are inexpensive  and are becoming ubiquitous (desktops, laptops,  PDAs, cell phones). In this paper, we present a face recognition  system based on kernel methods running on the GPU.  This GPU implementation is twenty eight times faster than  the same optimized application running on the CPU.
