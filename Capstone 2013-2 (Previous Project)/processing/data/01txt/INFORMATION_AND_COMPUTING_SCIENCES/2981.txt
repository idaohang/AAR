Most on-line cursive handwriting recognition systems use a lexical  constraint to help improve the recognition performance. Traditionally, the vocabulary  lexicon is stored in a trie (automaton whose underlying graph is a  tree). In a previous paper, we showed that non-deterministic automata were  computationally more efficient than tries. In this paper, we propose a new  method for constructing incrementally small non-deterministic automata from  lexicons. We present experimental results demonstrating a significant reduction  in the number of labels in the automata. This reduction yields a proportional  speed-up in HMM based lexically constrained pattern recognition systems.
