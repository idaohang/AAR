Within the area of Information Retrieval (IR) the importance of appropriate  ranking of results has increased markedly. The importance is magnified  in the case of systems dedicated to XML retrieval, since users of these systems  expect the retrieval of highly relevant and highly precise components, instead  of the retrieval of entire documents. As an international, coordinated effort  to evaluate the performance of Information Retrieval systems, the Initiative  for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) encourages participating organisation  to run queries on their search engines and to submit their result for the annual  INEX workshop. In previous INEX workshops the submitted results were  manually assessed by participants and the search engines were ranked in terms  of performance. This paper presents a Collective Ranking Strategy that outperforms  all search engines it is based on. Moreover it provides a system that is  trying to facilitate the ranking of participating search engines.
