&quot;Be not afraid of growing slowly; be only afraid of standing still&quot; (Chinese Proverb). The QUT Library has embraced their staff's fear of standing still by offering opportunities for multi-skilling through secondment. Staff have an opportunity to learn new skills, gain from new experiences and work in different teams, resulting in a &quot;big picture&quot; view of the organisation. This paper will present an overview of: - the secondment experience through the analysis of qualitative data gained through interviewing staff who have taken part in a secondment opportunity; - managers and supervisors who have lost and gained staff through secondment; and - teams who have had members come and go. Issues such as benefits for the individual and the organisation will be covered, as well as the effects on supervisors, management and other team members who then need to cope with constantly changing staff and new team dynamics.
