Medical images in digital form must be stored in a secure way to preserve stringent image quality standards and prevent unauthorised disclosure of   patient data. This paper proposes a multiple watermarking method to serve these purposes. A multiple watermark consists of an annotation part and a fragile part. Encrypted patient data can be embedded in   an annotation watermark, and tampering can be detected using a fragile watermark. The embedded patient data not only save storage space, it also offers   privacy and security. We also evaluate the imagesâ€™ visual quality after watermark embedding and the effectiveness of locating tampered regions.
