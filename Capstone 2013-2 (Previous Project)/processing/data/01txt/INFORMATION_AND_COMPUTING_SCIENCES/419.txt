In this paper we investigate denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities in Voice over IP (VoIP) systems, focusing on the ITU-T H.323 family of protocols. We provide a simple characterisation of DoS attacks that allows us to readily identify DoS issues in H.323 protocols. We also discuss network layer DoS vulnerabilities that affect VoIP systems. A number of improvements and further research directions are proposed.
