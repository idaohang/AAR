Research into the experience of international students presents a variety of challenges and lifelong learning opportunities, but scarce information is available on designing and conducting projects with this population. This paper focuses on higher education international students in Australia. It draws on cross-cultural research literature, plus the authorâ€™s research experience and anecdotal observations of students completing 2 Rodski library surveys. It emphasises the need for cross-cultural and second-language awareness throughout the research process and offers strategies for overcoming difficulties. It demonstrates the teaching and learning benefits that can flow from culturally sensitive project design and data collection.
