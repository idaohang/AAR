In this chapter, we introduce action research as a methodology that lends itself well to the emerging issues in the design, delivery and research of ICT systems and new media applications. We establish the relevance and rationale of action research by reviewing and critiquing the established epistemology in media and communication studies. Our analysis suggests that if action research approaches are adopted more in media and communication studies, they will enable the field to ground the study of media and communication by addressing real human and social problems. Action research presents a method of inquiry which finally resolves the tension between the observer and the observed by involving the observer in the experiences of the observed. This links up with the potential of action research to improve the design process and therefore the design of new media systems. The chapter sheds light onto the use of action research in the context of user-centred design of ICT and new media to produce actionable knowledge through learning and concludes by implying a number of imperatives in the future design of new media systems.
