Much research has been devoted over the years to investigating and advancing the techniques and tools used by analysts when they model. As opposed to what academics, software providers and their resellers promote as should be happening, the aim of this research was to determine whether practitioners still embraced conceptual modelling seriously. In addition, what are the most popular techniques and tools used for conceptual modelling? What are the major purposes for which conceptual modelling is used? The study found that the top six most frequently used modelling techniques and methods were ER diagramming, data flow diagramming, systems flowcharting, workflow modelling, RAD, and UML. However, the primary contribution of this study was the identification of the factors that uniquely influence the continued-use decision of analysts, viz., communication (using diagrams) to/from stakeholders, internal knowledge (lack of) of techniques, user expectations management, understanding models integration into the business, and tool/software deficiencies.
