A number of teaching and learning initiatives which aim to develop the generic skills of commencing undergraduate students are currently underway at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and a range of educational models have been adopted. QUT Library has taken a leading role in the development of information literacy and has collaborated closely with faculties to integrate information skills and concepts into the curriculum of a number of foundation units.    This paper presents three such case studies. It describes these cooperative Library-Faculty units and indicates the ways in which information literacy has been integrated into the course curriculum and structure. The case studies highlight various practical issues, such as collaborative planning and organisational processes, and explore in detail the logistics of delivery, skills assessment and program evaluation.     The paper also examines the educational and organisational context of these initiatives, including their relationships to generic graduate attributes, the University's Teaching and Learning agenda and the Library's &quot;Information Literacy Framework and CoRE Strategies&quot;.
