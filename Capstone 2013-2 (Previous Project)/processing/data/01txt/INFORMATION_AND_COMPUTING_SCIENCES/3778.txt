In this paper, we describe our system for writer independent, off-line unconstrained handwritten word recognition. We have developed a new method to automatically determine the parameters of Gabor filters to extract features from slant and tilt corrected images. An algorithm is also developed to translate 2D images to 1D domain. Finally, we propose a modified dynamic programming method with fuzzy theory to recognize words. Our initial experiments have shown promising results.
