Electronic communications devices intended for government or military applications must be rigorously evaluated to ensure that they maintain data confidentiality.  High-grade information security evaluations require a detailed analysis of the deviceâ€™s design, to determine how it achieves necessary security functions.  In practice, such evaluations are labour-intensive and costly, so there is a strong incentive to find ways to make the process more efficient. In this paper we show how well-known concepts from graph theory can be applied to a deviceâ€™s design to optimise information security evaluations. In particular, we use end-to-end graph traversals to eliminate components that do not need to be evaluated at all, and minimal cutsets to identify the smallest group of components that needs to be evaluated in depth.
