Since 1999, QUT has invested considerable effort in developing its IT Governance practices, procedures and capability. This paper will outline and discuss key aspects of that effort. A Vice-Chancellor chaired, strategic governance committee has been established. Annual production of an IT Portfolio provides an analysis of QUT's IT expenditure and provides informational context to inform IT governance. Central IT funding provision has been aligned with &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; capital expenditure in an Asset Management Plan. An over-arching project registry and surrounding &quot;gating&quot; processes and procedures are in place for centrally funded IT projects. The paper will also discuss the issues and contention surrounding determination of central IT expenditure and consider future development of the IT Governance agenda at QUT.
