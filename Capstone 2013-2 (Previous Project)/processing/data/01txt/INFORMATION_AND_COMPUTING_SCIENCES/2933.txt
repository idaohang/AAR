Business process management, and in particular workflow  management, are a major area of ICT research. At present no coherent  approach has been developed to address the problem of workflow visualisation to aid workers in the process of task prioritisation. In this paper we describe the development of a new, coherent approach to worklist visualisation, via analysis and development of a resource-centric view of the worklist information. We then derive appropriate visualisations for worklists and the relevant resources to aid worker in decision making. A worklist visualisation system has been implemented as an extension to an  open-source workflow system, YAWL (Yet AnotherWorkflow Language).
