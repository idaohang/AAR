The first year of operation of the Researchers' Centre of the Queensland University of Technology Library is reviewed. The impetus for the Centre, issues relating to its establishment, its daily management and evaluation of its operation, are discussed. The first of its type in Queensland and one of only a few in Australia, the Researchers' Centre aims to meet the information needs of research level students and academic staff through a combination of access to electronic products, on-hand expert advice, and state-of-the-art study space in a one-stop-shop operation. In contrast to areas dedicated to study space only, which universities have traditionally offered research students, the QUT Library Researchers' Centre offers value added facilities and services. Usage statistics, client feedback and interest from outside organisations are evidence of the Centre's success in achieving its aims
