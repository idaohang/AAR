Some applications in computer-aided design and computer vision areas require rough or inexact object models.  We propose a method for fuzzy shape specifications based on parametric geons and fuzzy set theory.  These fuzzy specifications are used to create customised 3D shapes to be stored  in a library for later use.   The shapes can be  retrieved using fuzzy global generic shape descriptors and fuzzy subjective shape descriptors nominated by an user.  The usefulness and limitations of this approach are also discussed.
