University libraries have traditionally played a central role in the institutional core business of creating and sharing knowledge.  With the emergence of new technologies, such as digitisation and the Internet, came new possibilities for storing, disseminating and using information resources created at the university â€“ not all involving the library.  By working collaboratively with other sections of the university in the development of these new systems, the university library continues to be a relevant and valued participant in this process. For example, university libraries can be instrumental in the development and maintenance of institutional repositories.  At Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, the library has played a key role in the development of a number of digital repositories.  These include an E-Print archive (QUT ePrints), the Australian Digital Thesis (ADT) collection, a Course Materials Database (CMD) and FlexiPrint, a student-driven print on-demand service of all compatible CMD and Online Teaching materials.  All of these projects involve collaboration between the Library and other University staff, eg academic staff, the QUT Office of Research, Teaching and Learning Support Services (TALSS), individual postgraduate students and even other universities. These repositories have enhanced the information resources available within QUT and have enabled the sharing of QUT-created information resources globally. The collaborative nature of the projects has also strengthened the partnership between the Library, other sections within the Division of Technology, Information and Learning Support and the QUT academic community.
