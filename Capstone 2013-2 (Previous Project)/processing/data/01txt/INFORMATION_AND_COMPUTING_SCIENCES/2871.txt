Mobile robots operating in unknown environments need to build maps. To do so they must have an exploration algorithm to plan a path. This algorithm should guarantee that the whole of the environment, or at least some designated area, will be mapped. The path should also be optimal in some sense and not simply a &quot;random walk&quot; which is clearly inefficient.  When multiple robots are involved, the algorithm also  needs to take advantage of the fact that the robots can  share the task. In this paper we discuss a modification  to the well-known distance transform that satisfies  these requirements.
