Modern real-time graphics systems are required to render millions  of polygons to the screen per second. However, even with this  high polygon rendering bandwidth, there are still applications  which tax this rendering capability. We introduce in this paper a  technique which adaptively allocates polygons to objects in a  scene according to their visual importance. It is expected that  using this technique, an improvement in the perceptual quality of  a rendered image should result, for the same overall number of  polygons being rendered.  We present both a theoretical basis and a complete design for  a visual attention-based level of detail management technique.  We also present some preliminary assessment of output from the  system. Applications for this technique are expected to be found  in the areas of entertainment, visualisation and simulation.
