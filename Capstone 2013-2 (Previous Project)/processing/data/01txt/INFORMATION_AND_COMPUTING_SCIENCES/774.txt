Increasing demand in mobile computing and multimedia market as well as other embedded devices has made it necessary to develop computer vision techniques which are more appropriate for these systems.  This paper firstly analyses requirements for embedded vision systems and issues involved in programming optimisation to meet these requirements.  Two case studies are then presented together with the analysis of results.
