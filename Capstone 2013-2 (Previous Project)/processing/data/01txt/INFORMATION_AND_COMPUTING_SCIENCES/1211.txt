In late 2003, Queensland University of Technology (QUT) endorsed a Teaching Capabilities Framework which aims to better understand both the teaching and learning environment of the university and the skills and capabilities which constitute good teaching practice.  This framework encompasses four key dimensions which encourage academic staff to adopt active, interactive and deep learning approaches to foster quality student learning outcomes:  Engaging learners; Designing for learning; Assessing for learning; Managing for learning.      This paper draws on the Teaching Capabilities Framework to evaluate the teaching practices within the Graduate Diploma of Library and Information Studies course at QUT.  The world of libraries and information agencies in the 21st century is highly dynamic, with technology driving innovative developments in the management and use of information.  Focusing on four core units of the course, the paper reflects on the studentsâ€™ journey to develop the knowledge and skills they will require for their future careers as information professionals.  The teaching team has adopted a holistic approach to teaching and learning, centring on the finely developed relationship between assessment, learning activities, learning supports and learning resources.  Accordingly, the curriculum covers not only discipline-specific issues, but also includes the development of the individual personal and interpersonal attributes which characterise the well-rounded, competent and confident new professional.  Curriculum development has been informed by two university-funded teaching and learning research projects, one to examine emerging discipline knowledge issues and one to identify key generic capabilities, keenly supported by industry practitioners and the professional association.
