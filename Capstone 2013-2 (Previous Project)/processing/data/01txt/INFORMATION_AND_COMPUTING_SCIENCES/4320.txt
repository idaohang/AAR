This paper discusses an application of an intelligent information system for decision-makers involved in multiple criteria group site selection problems under uncertainty. The fuzzy algorithm behind the system was developed by the authors for use in large-scale infrastructure site selection, and is validated here using a site selection problem at Brisbane Airport. The â€˜InfraPlannerâ€™ Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) was created by customising ArcView GIS, and operates on raster data files. The tightly coupled system features linguistic interaction, multiple decision-maker input, uncertainty assessment, and a linguistically controllable aggregation function capable of a variety of compensatory and non-compensatory outcomes. Feedback from decision-makers involved in the experiment indicated a high level of satisfaction with outputs from the system, whilst noting some areas for future development.
