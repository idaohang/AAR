Innovations in technology and rapid expansion of Library collections to include significant full text electronic resources are providing universities with exciting opportunities to provide students with high quality and flexible learning experiences.  Within this learning experience is a strong imperative to develop in students life long learning skills, which include information literacy skills. The realisation of this learning experience requires the development of a deep partnership and sharing of skills and knowledge between these key players: academics (content knowledge), Instructional designers (technical and pedagogical skills) and librarians (information skills)    This paper discusses new opportunities to integrate information resources and services into online teaching pages. The paper explores some of the people, processes and structural considerations organisations might consider to develop high quality on line learning experiences.
