The aim of the project reported here was to investigate dimensions of the collective consciousness of information technology (IT) research. In particular, the study explored how research students see:  â€¢ research, and particularly IT research;  â€¢ the information technology research field, or territory. What are the features of the field? What are its boundaries?; and  â€¢ the information technology research object. How do IT researchers see the â€˜thingsâ€™ underpinning their research? How do they collectively constitute or â€˜shapeâ€™ the object of IT research? What kinds of shared understandings do they have of their research object? How do their understandings differ?    The primary outcome from this study is a framework comprising a set of categories, each of which represents significant differences in IT research studentsâ€™ ways of seeing IT research, its objects and territories.
