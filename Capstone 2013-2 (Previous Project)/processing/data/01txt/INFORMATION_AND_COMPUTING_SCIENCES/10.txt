The Course Materials Database project at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) provides students with electronic access to the majority of their lecturer directed information resources via online teaching web pages for each subject. Resources include copyright materials, lecture notes and past exam papers. The online teaching pages also link from each student's portal on the QUT Intranet. The project integrates online information resources with courseware, conveniently arranged for the student in one place. Staff from several areas of the university have collaborated to achieve this streamlined service. The paper outlines the product, the process and what was learned.
