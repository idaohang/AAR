This paper presents a new method for the tracking of an object, and the determination of its absolute position using the image coordinates provided from multiple cameras. Existing methods used in multi-camera tracking systems require the calibration of all camera parameters, with re-calibration needed when cameras are moved. The proposed method obtains the image coordinates of an object at known locations and generates &quot;virtual points&quot; that are used as initial codebook vectors in a Self-Organising Map. This is achieved through a novel use of the cross-ratio invariance. The use of the Self-Organising Map also allows for camera movement, addition and removal without the need for re-calibration. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the tracking capability of the system.
