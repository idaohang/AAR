The capstone unit in the Graduate Diploma of Library and Information Studies course at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is ITN339 Professional Practice.  While the overarching goal of this unit is to prepare graduates for their new career as an information professional, the traditional classroom environment presents a number of challenges for teaching staff in terms of how to encourage students to truly engage in professional issues.  Innovative teaching and learning approaches have been introduced with the aim of supporting the graduateâ€™s transition from university into the workplace.  The teaching and learning process is viewed as a tri-partite relationship between students, academic staff and members of the profession, all working together to develop a well-rounded, competent and confident new professional.  The curriculum therefore covers not only discipline-specific issues, but also the development of the individual personal and interpersonal attributes which are required by students to be successful as they enter the workforce.  This paper outlines the teaching and learning approaches used in the unit: student-run colloquia, fieldwork and a professional portfolio represent the assessment tasks which enable students to demonstrate the multiple dimensions of their learning.  Extension activities are provided through a mentoring program and through their involvement in publishing an electronic newsletter. This unit has become an example of content and process coming together.  The professional networking required to establish the program reflects the essence of the program itself â€“ encouraging reciprocal professional development.  Both new and established professionals become aware of the productive ties between members of the profession and that beyond the professional interaction, real friendships can evolve, so that professional development is interwoven with personal self-development.
