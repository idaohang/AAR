This paper provides an overview of the Queensland University of Technology Uninhabited Airborne Vehicle (QUAV) Project. The undergraduate student project focuses on the development of a low-cost UAV for civilian airspace integration trials and as a test platform for research being conducted by the Airborne Avionics Research Group (AARG).This paper presents an overview of the avionics architecture and airworthiness framework developed and provides a discussion on the challenges to low-cost UAV development. Results from flight testing and the implementation of the airworthiness framework are presented as are design experiences such as the shift to Real-time Operating Systems (RTOS) and utilisation of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components for rapid prototyping.
