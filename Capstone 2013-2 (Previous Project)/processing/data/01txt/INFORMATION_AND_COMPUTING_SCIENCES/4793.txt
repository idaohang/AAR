Business process modeling has gained widespread acceptance and is employed as a design and management technique for a wide variety of purposes. While there has been much research on process modeling techniques and corresponding tools, there has been little empirical research into the important factors of effective process modeling, and the post-hoc evaluation of process modeling success. This study is the first that attempts to identify process modeling success factors and measures. This paper reports on the consolidated research findings of three case studies conducted in leading Australian organizations. It reports on an empirically derived Process Modeling Success model with success factors and success measures of business process modeling.
