An innovative partnership was established in 2002 between the Australian Library &amp; Information Association (ALIA) and the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) to provide a mentoring program for students in the Graduate Diploma of Library and Information Studies (GDLIS) course. The program was offered to students enrolled in the capstone Professional Practice unit of the course, which aims to prepare graduates for entry into their new careers.  In addition to the benefits gained by students through the close professional and social interaction with experienced practitioners, the program also increased the studentsâ€™ awareness of the value of the professional association and led directly to an increase in new members.  Many new professionals have accepted committee roles, bringing youthful energy and enthusiasm to the association.  The program is the focus for a research project into learning and professional development outcomes from mentoring and has won a university award for innovation in teaching.
