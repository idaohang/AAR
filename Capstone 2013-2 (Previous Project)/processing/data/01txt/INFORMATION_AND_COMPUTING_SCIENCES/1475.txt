Due to the XMLâ€™s flexibility and semi-structured nature, complications arise when trying to transplant data from one XML to another. Researchers have made great strides in solving the problem of integrating homogenous XML. But there are very few specifically addressing the problem of integrating heterogenous documents. We introduce XSD Matcher, a system for automatically mapping a collection of heterogeneous XML Schemaâ€™s. The key features of XSD Matcher are heterogenous domain, schema matching, element level granularity, use of linguistic and structure matching and exploiting type constraints. Experiments demonstrate that XSD Matcher is capable of identifying common elements between highly heterogenous XML schemas.
