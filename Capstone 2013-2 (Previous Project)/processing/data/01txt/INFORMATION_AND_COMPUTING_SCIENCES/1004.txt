The Faculty of Information Technology at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is committed to ensuring that its students are not only discipline savvy but highly information literate.  To facilitate the development of information literacy the Faculty, in collaboration with the universityâ€™s Teaching and Learning Support Services (TALSS), supported a project which involved the creation of an online learning tool known as the Reflective Online Searching Skills (ROSS) Environment.   ROSS aims to be a flexible and interactive online learning site for developing student skills and knowledge within the area of online searching.  The paper will outline the development of ROSS, explaining how QUTâ€™s Online Teaching (OLT) multimedia technology has been used in the learning environment.  A case study of how ROSS is being used within the unit ITB322 Information Resources will be presented. The paper discusses the practical implications of using online learning environments to facilitate student development of online searching skills. The discussion will focus on what the authors have learnt as educators and how they are continuing to craft the educational experience from a holistic perspective
