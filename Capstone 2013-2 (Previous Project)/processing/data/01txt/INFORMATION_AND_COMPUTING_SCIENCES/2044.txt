The paper studies the problem of information uncertainty evaluation in modern engineering and technology applications and especially system design. It analyses virtual environment design and engineering measurement systems. Information typical for those applications is classified according to its uncertainty types. Uncertainty sources are identified.  Fuzzy theory models are proposed. Examples of their applications in characteristic problems are given.
