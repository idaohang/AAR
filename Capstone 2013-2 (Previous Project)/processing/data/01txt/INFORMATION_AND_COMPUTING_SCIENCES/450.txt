Complex fuzzy systems exist in many applications and effective visualisation is required to gain insights in the nature and working of these systems, especially in the implication of impreciseness, its propagation and impacts on the quality and reliability of the outcomes.  This paper presents a design of a visualisation system based on multi-agent approach with the aim to facilitate the organisation and flow of complex tasks, their inter-relationships and their interactions with users.  This design extends our previous work on the analysis of the fundamental ontologies which underpin the structure and requirements of fuzzy systems.
