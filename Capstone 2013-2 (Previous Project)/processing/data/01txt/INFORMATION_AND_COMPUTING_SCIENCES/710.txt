As higher education continues to evolve in step with new approaches to learning and teaching, so, too, is the role of the academic teaching librarian changing as they seek to develop, devise and implement systems and strategies which foster embedded learning of information literacy in the curriculum.     Comprehensive â€œcurricula infusionâ€¿ demands systemic and systematic change in the design and delivery of core curricula to ensure that the mastery of information literacy concepts and skills occurs in a sequential, hierarchical and developmental manner. In order to inform and lead systemic change, the academic librarian now needs to demonstrate a breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding across a broad range of educational and strategic arenas, including &quot;learning theory, assessment and evaluation, pedagogical realignment, course reform, policy development and strategic planning, university-wide organisational infrastructure, print and online learning resources, teaching and learning partnerships and staff developmentâ€¿. In addition, to facilitate quality outcomes and to work in effective collaborative partnership with academic colleagues, the academic teaching librarian must also be able to â€œdeliverâ€¿ in terms of teaching skills and learning facilitation.    Only when these librarians are equipped with the specialist knowledge and skills they require to fully engage with, and be integrated into, the learning and teaching processes of an organisation will conditions exist which support and foster a systemic process which enables and empowers students â€œas critical and independent users of information by embedding information literacy skills, as an â€œemerging skillâ€¿ and key generic capability, into the whole learning experience.â€¿
