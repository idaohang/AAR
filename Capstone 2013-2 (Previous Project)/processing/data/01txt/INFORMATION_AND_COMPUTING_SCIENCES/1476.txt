XML is touted as the breakthrough in data exchange on the web. As XML material becomes more abundant, the ability to gain knowledge from XML sources decreases. Thus, there is a great need to apply data mining techniques to XML data. This paper suggests taxonomy of XML mining as a stepping-stone to further XML mining research. This paper explicitly expresses the available classes of XML material. This paper also proposes/surveys a number of possible data mining techniques that can be applied on structure or content of XML documents.
