This paper describes the work-in-progress of creating an artificial 3D environment and robot, suitable for educational simulation. A 3D vehicle robot, equipped with a monocular camera navigates in a physics based 3D environment, with some artificial intelligence capabilities. Students can interact with the robot, add new objects and set the robot for some tasks. This multimedia tool is designed for student with very little experience with robotics.
