This presentation considers aspects of current user service from two viewpoints - (i) what is it that a contemporary information user considers service to be, and (ii) the extent to which personal facilitation by an intermediate professional is necessary for user support. This is approached firstly, by considering the motivation for self-service in the digital environment. Then some attention is given to support for 'reintermediation' in digital business processes. Three examples: information architect, knowledge manager, and facilitator are then examined as cases, to consider how end users of information in different settings make use of intermediaries. These environments are contrasted with developments in academic teaching and learning, and what it is that constitutes intermediation in such an environment. Some observations are made about the continuing role of the librarian for provision of information support in a situation where information delivery is becoming predominantly electronic.
