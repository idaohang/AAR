Web services composition is an emerging paradigm forapplication integration within and across organizational boundaries. A landscape of languages and techniques for web services composition has emerged and is continuously beingenriched with new proposals from different vendors and coalitions.However, little effort has been dedicated to systematically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of these languages and techniques.
