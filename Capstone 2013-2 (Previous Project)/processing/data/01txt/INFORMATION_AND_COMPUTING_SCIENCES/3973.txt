Technological support for university education is now such that online support for education is diminishing the distinction between on-campus and distance education students. Library services to remote students have for some time focused on document delivery, information literacy and reference service. This investigation comprises an overview of research that is pertinent to such services, followed by elements of a proposed framework for library involvement in remote education    The analysis includes an overview of services provided by respondents to a survey of all Australian university libraries. The framework is developed from this overview, followed up by case studies of several Australian university libraries that have well-developed services for remote students, in order to suggest a best practice model for integrated online services.
