The beginning of the 21st century is a challenging period for educators who are charged with the development of the new information professional while contending with the multiple demands of students, employers, professional bodies, university managers and governments.  This paper has been informed by the literature review undertaken by the authors as the initial component of a research project which aimed to explore the core knowledge and skills required by the successful modern day library and information professional.  Drawing on the review of the literature, the paper considers three main, and intertwined, issues currently affecting LIS education across the world: the focus of LIS education, the process of LIS education and the accreditation of LIS education.
