At Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane Australia, PhD and Masters by Research  candidates are required to deposit both print and digital copies of their theses and dissertations. The fulltext  of these digital theses is then made freely available online via the Australian Digital Thesis (ADT)  collection. Management of copyright issues has been a major headache and workload problem for the  Library: there are many parties involved in the deposit process, and the lack of a common understanding  about the rights and responsibilities of the various stakeholders has made the process very complex and  time consuming. The response of some universities has been to limit access to just the metadata and  abstract. At QUT this is not an option as the University is committed to freeing up access to publicly  funded research and its outputs. QUT is also at the forefront of various open access initiatives, including  the Open Access to Knowledge Law (OAK Law) Project that is working to develop legal protocols for  managing copyright issues in an open access environment and investigate provision and implementation  of a rights expression language for implementing such protocols. This paper discusses the aims of this  project in relation to the QUT ETD experience, as well as how these fit in with the larger ETD open  access environment.
