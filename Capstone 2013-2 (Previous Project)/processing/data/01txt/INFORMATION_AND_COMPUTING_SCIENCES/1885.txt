Differentiation between on-campus and distance education students has diminished as universities put more resources into online education. Library services that have focused on resource delivery for remote students have expanded to facilitate online reference and information literacy instruction. These services must now be situated within a strategic framework that embraces many features including information policy, collaboration, information organization and learning process support.    A multi-method analysis comprising case study, interview and literature survey of Australian university services is underway in order to propose a model that libraries should address for successful online service. This preliminary analysis reports upon the framework that has been suggested by the data collected so far.
