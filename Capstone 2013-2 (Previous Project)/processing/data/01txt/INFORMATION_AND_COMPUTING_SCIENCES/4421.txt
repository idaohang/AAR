A security proof in the Bellareâ€“Rogaway model and the random oracle model is provided for a protocol closely based on one originally proposed by Boyd (1996), which enjoys some remarkable efficiency properties. The model is extended so that it can detect a known weakness of the protocol that cannot be captured in the original model. An alternative protocol, provably secure in the extended model and the random oracle model, offering the same efficiency features as the original protocol is proposed. Moreover, our alternative protocol provides key confirmation and forward secrecy. It also allows session keys to be renewed in subsequent sessions without the serverâ€™s further involvement even in the event that the long-term key or the earlier session key have  been compromised.
