At Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia, we introduced a university-wide self-archiving policy in January 2004. The endorsement of the policy happily coincided with the launch of QUTâ€™s new eprint repository, QUT ePrints.     What was the reaction of the QUT research community to the policy?  Well, the sky didnâ€™t fall in.  So far, no objections to the concept or to the actual policy have been expressed.  Has the policy facilitated efforts to populate QUT ePrints?  In many ways, yes it has. While QUT ePrints was not immediately inundated with self-archived papers, within six months over two hundred papers have been deposited and the deposit rate is increasing steadily.  Some disciplines have shown more enthusiasm, and depositing activity, than others. It has become apparent that our communication and promotion strategies and the supports provided need to be customised to suit the interests and research practices of each discipline group. A â€œone size fits allâ€¿ approach  was not very effective.    This paper will briefly describe the policyâ€™s formulation and endorsement process and the way that the policy is currently represented and promoted to QUT researchers. It will also describe, and discuss the relative effectiveness of the various strategies that have been adopted at QUT to encourage and support self-archiving within the University.
