Present fuzzy system visualisations, while being useful  have been ad hoc in nature.  In this paper we present a new integrated task-oriented approach to the visualisation of fuzzy logic systems.  In addition, this approach is incorporated into an agent-based software architecture to guide the user through the process of developing a fuzzy logic system visualisation.  A case study then illustrates a structured walk through of the new approach with an electricity spot price prediction application.
