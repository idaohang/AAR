This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the working  and requirements of fuzzy systems with the view to devise  appropriate visualisation framework and techniques for these  systems using a user- and task-oriented approach. We firstly  discuss the nature of fuzzy data and the essential components of  typical fuzzy systems, then categorise different visualisation  requirements from three perspectives: user of fuzzy systems,  designer of fuzzy systems and designer of visualisation systems.  The visualisation framework also include mechanisms for  capturing usersâ€™ profiles in order to customise the system to their  own needs. We then examine how different visualisation  techniques can be adapted to satisfy these requirements.  Motivations for an architecture of a visualisation system which  is based on a multi-agent approach are also presented.
