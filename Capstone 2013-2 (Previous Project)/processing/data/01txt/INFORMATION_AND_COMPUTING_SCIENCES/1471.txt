Artificial neural networks (ANN) have demonstrated good predictive  performance in a wide variety of practical problems. However, due  to poor comprehensibility of the learned ANN, and the inability to  represent explanation structures, ANNs are not considered  sufficient for the general representation of knowledge. This paper  details a methodology that represents the knowledge of a trained  network in the form of restricted first-order logic rules, and  subsequently allows user interaction by interfacing with a  knowledge based reasoner.
