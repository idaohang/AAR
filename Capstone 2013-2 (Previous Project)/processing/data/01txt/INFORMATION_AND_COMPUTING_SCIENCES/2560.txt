A hybrid watermark that consists of a robust part and a fragile part   can be used to serve multiple purposes. The robust part can protect copyright   information, the fragile part can detect tampering, and their combination enables identification of attacks encountered. This paper analyses an overlap and   a non-overlap implementation of the robust and fragile parts in a hybrid system.   The difference between the two implementation methods lies in the robust and   fragile watermarks embedding positions. Embedding capacity, computational   costs, watermark robustness, and tamper detection localization of the two implementations are analyzed. In addition, optimization issues of block size in the   hybrid system are discussed.
