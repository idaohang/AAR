This paper discusses a research project that identifies the skills, knowledge and attitudes of the archetypal information professional for the twenty-first century.  Participants in the study include library and information professionals, educators and students from South East Queensland.  Focus groups were used for data collection. In the field of genetics it is commonly accepted that every individual (apart from identical twins) has a unique pattern of DNA.  This pattern determines the characteristics and qualities that a person possesses.  The current research project aims to extrapolate the concept of &quot;unique patterns of DNA&quot; to determine the specific characteristics and qualities of the information professional.   Building on the double helix image of human DNA, the DNA of the information professional consists of two intertwined and complementary strands.  These strands incorporate discipline knowledge and generic capabilities, which together make up the genome of the successful information professional in the information age.   The paper will provide a discussion on the preliminary findings that have emerged from the research in these two areas.  The research is significant because it establishes an open dialogue between current industry professionals, library science educators and the professional association on the traditional and evolving skills and knowledge required by information professional in the twenty-first century.  The dialogue will guide the development of current and future education of library and information professionals
