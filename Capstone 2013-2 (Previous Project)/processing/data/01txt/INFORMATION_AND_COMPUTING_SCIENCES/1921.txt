Charles Sturt University (CSU) published the book 'Information management: a consolidation of operations, analysis and strategy' in 2002 (available from the publisher or other book suppliers).    This is a set of exercises that was separately commissioned and e-published by CSU. The exercises do not appear in the book but correspond with chapters in the book dealing with various aspects of information management.
