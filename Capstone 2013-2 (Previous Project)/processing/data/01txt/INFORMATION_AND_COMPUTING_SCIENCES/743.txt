Currently, most content based image retrieval (CBIR) systems operate on all images, without sorting images into different types or categories. Different images have different characteristics and thus often require different analysis techniques and query types. Additionally, placing an image into a category can help the user to navigate retrieval results more effectively. To categorise an image, firstly the dominant region needs to be extracted using multi level colour segmentation. Based on the regionsâ€™ features of colour, texture, shape and relation between regions, the image is then categorised. Users are presented with retrieval results sorted into different categories, where dominant region extraction will allow for object based retrieval to be performed.
