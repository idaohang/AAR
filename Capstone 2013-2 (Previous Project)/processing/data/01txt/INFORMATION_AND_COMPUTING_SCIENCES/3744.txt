Traditional information retrieval (IR)  systems respond to user queries with ranked lists  of relevant documents. The separation of content  and structure in XML documents allows  individual XML elements to be selected in  isolation. Thus, users expect XML-IR systems to  return highly relevant results that are more  precise than entire documents. This paper  presents such a system. The system accepts  queries in both natural language (English) and  formal XPath-like format (NEXI) and matches to  a set of relevant and appropriately-sized  elements using an effective ranking scheme.
