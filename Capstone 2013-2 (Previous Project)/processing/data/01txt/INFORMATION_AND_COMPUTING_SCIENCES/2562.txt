The essential performance metrics of a robust watermark   include robustness, imperceptibility, watermark capacity   and security. In addition, computational cost is important   for practicality. Wavelet-based image watermarking   methods exploit the frequency information and spatial   information of the transformed data in multiple   resolutions to gain robustness. Although the Human   Visual System (HVS) model offers imperceptibility in   wavelet-based watermarking, it suffers high   computational cost. In this paper, we examine embedding   strength determined by a HVS model, a constant, and a   simplified technique. The proposed simplified embedding   technique significantly reduces embedding time while   preserving the performance of imperceptibility and   robustness. The fast embedding technique exploits   implicit features of discrete wavelet transform (DWT)   sub-bands, i.e. the luminosity information in the low pass   band, and the edge information in the high pass bands. It   achieves embedding speed comparable to a constant   energy embedding process. Robustness is demonstrated   with a few conventional attacks, e.g. JPEG compression,   Gaussian noise insertion, image cropping, contrast   adjustment, median filtering, and global geometrical   distortion. Experimental visual quality is measured in   Weighted-Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (W-PSNR) for high   accuracy. Robustness and imperceptibility of HVS-based   embedding could be trade-off with computational   simplicity of a fast embedding technique.
