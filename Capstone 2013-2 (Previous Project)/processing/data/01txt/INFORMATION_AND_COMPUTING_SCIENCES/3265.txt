Single-dimension negotiations protocols have been replaced lately by more flexible negotiations models. Co-operative negotiations (decision making processes resolving conflicts and involving two or more parties over multiple, independant, but not mutually exclusive goals) suggest new &quot;win-win&quot; type models. Agent mediated electronic commerce models require new new protocols with enhanced capabilities, including multi-attribute bids capabilities and complex evaluation methods. One major issue that remains unresolved is the disclosure of the preference schemes of the parties in the pre-negotiation phase.The byuyr's preference definition (discrete or continuous) being of scalar or non-scalar value and the difficulty of mutually evaluating the preference schemes of byuers and sellers require new protocol models. The paper proposes a model for a new negotiation protocol for a multi-buyer multi-seller interaction.Single-dimension negotiations protocols have been replaced lately by more flexible negotiations models.

Agent mediated electronic commerce requires the design of new types of protocols with enhanced capabilities, including multi-attribute bidsâ€™ capabilities and complex evaluation capabilities. One major issue that remains unresolved is the disclosure of the preference schemes of the parties in the pre-negotiation phase. The buyer's preference definition (discrete or continuous) being of scalar or non-scalar value and the difficulty of mutually evaluating the preference schemes of buyers and sellers require new evaluation approaches. The paper proposes a model for a negotiation protocol for a multi-buyer, multi-seller interaction.
