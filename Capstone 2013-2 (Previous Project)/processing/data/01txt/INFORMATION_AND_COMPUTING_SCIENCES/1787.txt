The development of new Web services by composition of  existing ones is becoming a widespread approach to realise  business-to-business collaborations. The composite services obtained  in this way are then eventually used in other compositions. Given the  dynamic nature of the Web, this recursive composition of  services rapidly leads to intricate dependencies between them. On the  other hand, businesses need to track the executions of their  composite services in order to ensure explainability in case  of failure and to support decision making.  This paper deals with the  issue of tracing composite service executions over the Web. It  describes a model and an XML representation of service execution  traces, an approach for collecting and storing these traces in a  distributed environment, and an approach to evaluate queries over  distributed repositories of traces.
