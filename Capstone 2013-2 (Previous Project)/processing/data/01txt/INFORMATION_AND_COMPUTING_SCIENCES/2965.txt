The information literacy (IL) research territory has been maturing over the last decade. As Bruce (2000) suggests, this research territory may be described in term of five dimensions: 1) the sectoral location of the research; 2) ways of seeing IL; 3) what is being investigated â€“ the research object;  4) how the object is being investigated â€“ the research approach; and 5) disciplinary influences. She also suggests likely trajectories for future IL research include: Growth beyond the educational sector; Attention to a wider variety of cultural settings; A firmer more consolidated research agenda; Greater collaboration between researchers; An agenda driven by funding priorities.  This paper reviews the development of IL research in Australia from 2000 through to 2005, and considers future directions. It presents a picture of evolving understanding of IL and a diversification of research contexts and approaches. Although educationally focussed projects predominate, increasing research activity is occurring in workplace and community settings. Interest in different cultural settings is also emerging, with investigations being initiated across cultures and into cultural influences.
