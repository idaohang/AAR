This paper presents a performance analysis of a cellular system which uses an adaptive antenna array in conjunction with a space division multiple access (SDMA) based dynamic channel allocation scheme. The channel allocation scheme is necessary because in SDMA systems there is channel re-use, which must be &quot;intelligently&quot; handled. The system analysed is shown to give significantly improved performance over that attainable with conventional (non-adaptive) antennas. The analysis includes a simulation of a realistic communications system, complete with coding, modulation, multipath transmission, direction of arrival estimation, beamforming, demodulation and decoding
