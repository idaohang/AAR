Manufacturing and mining automation, robotics, swarms and smart device networks are often implemented upon distributed embedded systems. These systems are typically statically distributed, coarsely reconï¬¿gurable or deployed on homogeneous networks. A conceptual stack can be formed using modelling languages, system performance analysis and optimisation and reconï¬¿gurable platform-neutral components to overcome these problems. A framework for computational intelligence-based applications to be built upon this stack has been proposed. Model-Driven Architecuture has been shown to be a promising standard  for the modelling, design and development of embedded applications. The Theory of Constraints is proposed as a potential technique for performance analysis and optimisation of distributed systems. Mobile Agents and code mobility can be used in the component architecture to allow for adaptation and reconï¬¿guration for optimisation.
