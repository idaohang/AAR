Queensland University of Technology (QUT) Library, using a process improvement concept of benchmarking, compared its acquisitions and cataloguing, document delivery and research support services with those of the University of New South Wales Library.  The paper discusses experience and outcomes from the point of view of  the benchmarking proposer and the partner.  The results were a catalyst for change in some areas at QUT.  Benchmarking places great demands on staff  at both proposer and partner organisations to understand concepts and process and to provide information; an organisational framework is desirable for both proposer and partner. Questionnaire outlines are presented. Great care in interpreting information is necessary. The use of common output and performance measures facilitates benchmarking and continued development of these by academic libraries is essential for it to be a useful tool for process improvement.
