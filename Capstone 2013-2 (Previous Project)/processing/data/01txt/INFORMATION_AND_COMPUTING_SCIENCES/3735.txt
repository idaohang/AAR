Users of information retrieval (IR) systems require an interface that is  powerful and easy-to-use in order to fulfill their information requirement. In  XML-IR systems this is a non-trivial task since users expect these systems to  fulfill both their structural and content requirements. Most existing XML-IR  systems accept queries formatted in formal query languages, however, these  languages are difficult to use. This paper presents NLPX â€“ an XML-IR system  with a natural language interface that is user friendly enough so it can be used  intuitively, but sophisticated enough to be able to handle complex structured  queries. NLPX accepts English queries that contain both usersâ€™ content and  structural requirements. It uses a set of grammar templates to derive the structural  and content requirements and translates them into a formal language  (NEXI). The formal language queries can then be processed by many existing  XML-IR systems. The system was developed for participation in the NLP  Track of the INEX 2004 Workshop, and results indicated that natural language  interfaces are able to capture usersâ€™ structural and content requirements, but not  as accurately as some formal language interfaces.
