A recent paper by the QUT Vice-Chancellor, â€œFraming our Futureâ€¿, called on QUT staff to experiment, engage and regenerate. This paper discusses ways in which the QUT Library has already begun to experiment with new services, engage in new business interdependencies, and regenerate the roles of staff in Lending and Library Resource Services. This is being done by using existing Library strengths in knowledge management, and building new ones in partnership with other areas of the University. QUT Library implemented the Course Materials Database in 2001. The Course materials Database is designed to enable digitisation of copyright materials previously held in hard copy reserve collections, and make resources available to students 24/7. Sophisticated copyright management strategies designed by the Library will also be used to centrally manage copyright compliance for other areas of the University. Library Resource Services and Lending Services staff have developed expertise in scanning and digitisation techniques, and the Library Systems staff have collaborated with Information Technology Services in the design of the database. As the second stage of the project, loading of External Studies and coursepack material has progressed, new business relationships with the Teaching and Learning Services Staff, the University Printing Services including Student Copying and Printing Services, and the University Bookshop have been created, and some exciting opportunities are developing for the Library to extend its influence within the University. A new â€œprint-on-demandâ€¿ option is jointly being developed. These emerging interdependencies will allow the development of new roles and skills within the Library, and enable new career paths for professional and non-professional Library staff.
