Visual inspection of the tongue has been an important diagnostic method of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).   Clinic data have shown significant connections between various viscera cancers and abnormalities in the tongue and the tongue coating.  Visual inspection of the tongue is simple and inexpensive, but the current practice in TCM is mainly experience-based and the quality of the visual inspection varies between individuals. The computerized inspection method provides quantitative models to evaluate color, texture and surface features on the tongue. In this paper, we investigate visualization  techniques and processes  to allow interactive data analysis with the aim to merge computerized measurements with human expert's diagnostic variables based on five-scale diagnostic conditions: Healthy (H),  History Cancers (HC),  History of Polyps (HP),  Polyps (P) and Colon Cancer (C).
