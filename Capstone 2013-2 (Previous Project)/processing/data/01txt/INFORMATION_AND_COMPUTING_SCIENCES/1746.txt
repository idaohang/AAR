Libraries throughout the world are facing the dual challenge of an aging workforce and a workplace which is requiring significant reassessment of the skills base of its staff as a result of the impact of technology on the delivery of information services. The implications for libraries in responding to this environment are significant. This paper looks at the age profile of the library workforce and discusses the need for libraries to acknowledge and plan for the impending retirement of a significant proportion of their workforce. The paper argues that integral to this planning is the need to identify the skills and attributes required of library staff in both the short and long term. The response of some Australian academic libraries in preparing to address these challenges is described. Particular reference is made to strategies adopted at Queensland University of Technology Library in Brisbane, Australia to ensure that existing and new staff are equipped with the skills to be able to work in changing environments and that staff are provided with opportunities to develop leadership skills that will be required for the future.
