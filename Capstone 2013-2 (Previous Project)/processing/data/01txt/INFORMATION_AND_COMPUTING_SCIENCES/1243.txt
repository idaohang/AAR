There are many ways of achieving scalable dynamic web content. In previous work we have focused on dynamic content degradation using a standard architecture and a design-time 'Just In Case' methodology. In this paper, we address certain shortcomings witnessed in our previous work by using an alternate coordination-based architecture, which has interesting applicability to run-time web server adaptation. We first establish the viability of using this architecture for high-volume dynamic web content generation. In doing so, we establish its ability to maintain high throughput in overload conditions. We go on to show how we used the architecture to achieve a 'Just In Time' adaptation to achieve dynamic web content degradation in a running web application server.
