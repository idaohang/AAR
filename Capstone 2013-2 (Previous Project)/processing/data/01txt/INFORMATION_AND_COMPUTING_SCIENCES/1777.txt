Web service deployment is hampered by the possibility of sudden  variations in request volumes. Mechanisms exist to enhance scalability  in times of heavy load when the delivered content is static. However,  web services typically involve dynamic content, delivered through  application servers which may have little to no support for adapting  to varying loads in order to ensure timely delivery. In this paper we  discuss why scaling dynamic content delivery under load is difficult,  we present a technique for controlled service degradation to achieve  this scalability, and we present experimental results evaluating its  benefits.
