Since 2002, INEX has been the benchmark for evaluating XML  information retrieval (XML-IR) systems. INEX has based much  of its evaluation methodology on that of existing workshops,  albeit modified for the specific requirements of XML-IR. Due to  some of the modifications, the time spent during evaluation  phase of INEX takes a lot longer than comparable workshops.  Here, we investigate ways to speed up the INEX evaluation  process. We also investigate some structural changes and  additional tasks that could be preformed at future INEX  workshops.
