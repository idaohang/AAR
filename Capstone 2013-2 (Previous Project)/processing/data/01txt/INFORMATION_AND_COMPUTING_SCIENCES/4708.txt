In emerging web service development approaches, the description of interactions both from a global and from a local perspective plays an increasingly important role. In earlier work we presented a visual language (namely Letâ€™s Dance) for modeling service interactions at different levels of abstraction. In this paper we present a modeling tool for Letâ€™s Dance. The tool supports the static analysis of global models, the generation of local models from global ones, and the interactive simulation of both local and global models.
