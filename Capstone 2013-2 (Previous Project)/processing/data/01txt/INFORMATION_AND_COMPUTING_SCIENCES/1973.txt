Evidence Based Practice (EBP) has recently emerged as a topic of discussion amongst professionals within the library and information industry.  Simply stated, EBP is the process of using formal research skills and methods to assist in decision making and establishing best practice. The emerging interest in the EBP within the library context serves to remind the library profession that research skills and methods will ensure that the library industry remains current and relevant in a rapidly changing environment.   The future of EBP within the library context relies upon effective cooperation between industry professionals, library science educators and professional associations.  This paper will consider the role of library science education in ensuring the future of EBP within librarianship.  Aware of its role to industry as a supplier of employees to the marketplace, the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is continually reviewing its library science curriculum to more readily embrace the needs of current industry practice. This paper will discuss the teaching and learning model that is being at the Queensland University of Technology to foster student awareness and understanding of EBP and its practical role in the library and information industry.  The paper examines the experiences of both the teaching staff and the students in practicing EBP within an industry context and considers the contribution the course makes in developing an EBP culture within the Australian library and information profession.
