This paper presents a validated measurement model and instrument for assessing enterprise systems success from multiple perspectives. The final validated study model employs 27 measures of the four dimensions: information quality, system quality, individual impact, and organizational impact. The model is empirically tested with survey data gathered from 27 public sector organizations that implemented SAP R/3 in the late 1990s. The study consists of an exploratory inventory survey (model building) to identify the salient success dimensions and measures, followed by a confirmatory weights survey, for testing model validity (model testing). Test results demonstrate the discriminant validity of the four dimensions, as well as their convergence on a single higher-order phenomenon: enterprise systems success (ESS). Criterion validity testing further demonstrates the additivity of the four dimensions of success, and the completeness of the resultant overarching, second-order measure of ESS.
