Multiple criteria group site selection problems involve a group of individuals evaluating a set of alternative sites on the basis of multiple criteria. This paper presents an application of a new fuzzy algorithm for finding and exploring potential solutions to these problems in a raster Geographical Information System (GIS) environment. Linguistic assessments from decision-makers are represented as triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNâ€™s), which are adjusted for uncertainty in the source data and its relationship to suitability by using an approach based on type-2 fuzzy sets. The first aggregation of inputs is a compensatory one based on fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) theory. An adjusted aggregation then factors in conflicts, risks and uncertainties to enable a variety of compensatory and non-compensatory outcomes to be generated based on decision-maker preferences. The algorithm was implemented in ArcView GIS as part of an ongoing collaborative project with Brisbane Airport. This paper outlines the fuzzy algorithm and its use in site selection for a recycling facility on the Brisbane Airport site.
