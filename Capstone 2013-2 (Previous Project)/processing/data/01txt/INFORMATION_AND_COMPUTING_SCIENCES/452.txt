Exact low level geometric representations in current CAD systems cannot reflect design intents at conceptual stage and using such representation for model construction is very time consuming and not intuitive.  This paper presents a unified approach for imprecise solid modelling based on fuzzy logic which allows users to specify their vague design intents to obtain a rough shape representation and to  perform important tasks on this rough model while retaining its fuzzy characteristics.  These tasks range from fuzzy shape specification, representation, indexing, retrieval to shape evolution and comparison using fuzzy fitness and similarity measures.  They are achieved via fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy operations on fuzzy geometric entities.  We also discuss how fuzzy reasoning can be used in composite shape construction and configuration design.  These methods have been realised for geometric entities based on deformable superquadrics. Ongoing work is being carried out to extend these concepts to generic geometric primitives and to integrate fuzzy design constraints to two design paradigms: fuzzy parametric and fuzzy feature-based design.
