Present ray tracing algorithms are computationally intensive,  requiring hours of computing time for complex scenes. Our  previous work has dealt with the development of an overall  approach to the application of visual attention to progressive  and adaptive ray-tracing techniques. The approach facilitates  large computational savings by modulating the supersampling  rates in an image by the visual importance of the region being  rendered.  This paper extends the approach by incorporating temporal  changes into the models and techniques developed, as it is  expected that further efficiency savings can be reaped for  animated scenes. Applications for this approach include  entertainment, visualisation and simulation.
