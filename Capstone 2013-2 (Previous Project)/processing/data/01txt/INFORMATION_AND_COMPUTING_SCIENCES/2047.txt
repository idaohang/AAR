This paper proposed a systematic approach for exploring the interactions of aesthetic properties and design variables, by integrating knowledge from other fields such as philosophy, psychology and arts. Commonly-accepted aesthetic properties and language terms used for evaluation and criticism are first discussed and a common set of nine principles for achieving aesthetic products in a number of creative disciplines is identified.  We then analyse the way these principles influence product characteristics and extract concrete and computable properties of products that may be varied to induce different aesthetic judgements and responses.
