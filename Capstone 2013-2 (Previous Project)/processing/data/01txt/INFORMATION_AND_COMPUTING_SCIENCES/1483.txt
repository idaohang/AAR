Data mining techniques provide people with new power to research and manipulate the existing large volume of data. A data mining process discovers interesting information from the hidden data that can either be used for future prediction and/or intelligently summarising the details of the data. There are many achievements of applying data mining techniques in various areas such as marketing, medical, and financial, although few of them can be currently seen in software engineering domain. In this paper, a proposed data mining application in software engineering domain is explained and experimented. The empirical results demonstrate the capability of data mining techniques in software engineering domain and the potential benefits in applying data mining in this area.
