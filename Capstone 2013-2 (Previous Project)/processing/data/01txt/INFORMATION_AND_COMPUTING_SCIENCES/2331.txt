This paper proposes a visualization technique to support the  modelling and management of large business process specifications. The  technique uses a set of criteria to produce views of the specification that  exclude less relevant features. The proposed approach consists of three  steps: assessing the relevance of nodes, reducing the specification, and  presenting the results. Algorithms and methods are presented for these  steps along with examples.
