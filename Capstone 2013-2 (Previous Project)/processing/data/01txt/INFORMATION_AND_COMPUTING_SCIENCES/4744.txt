In this paper we report results from three studies examining 1295 relevance judgments by 36 IR system end-users. We examined both the region of the relevance judgment, from non-relevant to highly relevant, and motivations or levels of their relevance judgments. Our study has three major findings. First, the frequency distributions of relevance judgments by IR system end-users tend to take on a bi-modal shape with peaks at the extremes (non relevant/relevant) with a flatter middle range. Second, the different type of scale (interval or ordinal) used in each study did not alter the shape of the relevance frequency distributions. And third, on an interval scale, the median point of relevance judgment distributions correlates with the point where relevant and partially relevant items begin to be retrieved. The median point of a relevance judgment distribution may provide a measure of user/IR system interaction to supplement precision/recall measures. The implications of our investigation for relevance theory and IR systems evaluation are discussed.
