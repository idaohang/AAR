This paper presents a highly parallel implementation of a  new type of Self-Organising Map (SOM) using graphics hardware. The  Parameter-Less SOM smoothly adapts to new data while preserving the  mapping formed by previous data. It is therefore in principle highly  suited for interactive use, however for large data sets the computational  requirements are prohibitive. This paper will present an implementation  on commodity graphics hardware which uses two forms of parallelism  to signiÂ¯cantly reduce this barrier. The performance is analysed experi-  mentally and algorithmically. An advantage to using graphics hardware  is that visualisation is essentially free&quot;, thus increasing its suitability  for interactive exploration of large data sets.
