The trends in higher education towards internationalisation and increasing dependence on ICTs (information and communication technologies) are contributing to the diversification of the student population and their learning needs. In this context learners may encounter an array of educational and technological challenges. For international students these challenges may be compounded by differences in cultural and linguistic backgrounds and limited previous experience of independent learning and library and online use. This article discusses the interim findings of a research project into the use of online information resources by group of international students at an Australian university. It describes the studentsâ€™ online behaviour (actions), their affective and cognitive responses (reactions) and associated difficulties. It discusses the implications for information literacy education and online resource development related to cultural and linguistic diversity.
