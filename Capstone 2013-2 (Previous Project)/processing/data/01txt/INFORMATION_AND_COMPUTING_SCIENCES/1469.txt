XML is the new standard for information exchange and retrieval. As XML material becomes more abundant, the ability to gain knowledge from XML sources decreases due to their heterogeneity and structural irregularity. Thus utilizing data mining techniques for improving XML document handling becomes essential. This chapter presents a taxonomy of XML mining and explicitly expresses the available classes of XML material. This chapter also presents a number of techniques and tools that can be applied on structure or content of XML documents for the aim of knowledge discovery.
