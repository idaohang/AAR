There is an ever increasing demand for higher levels of visual  detail in graphical applications, particularly in computer  games and applications employing visualisation. Triangle  strips have been commonly used to optimise the rendering of  large geometric meshes. This paper investigates the process  of generating optimal triangle strips through the use of genetic  algorithms (GA), to remove the need for special knowledge of  the intended hardware platform. Two methods â€“ L-System  encoding and parameter tuning of an established algorithm  were implemented and tested. The results of this work show  that over an extended period of time, solutions can be  achieved that are comparable to existing triangle stripping  techniques, but the best results were obtained from using the  GA to tune the parameters of an existing triangle stripping  algorithm.
