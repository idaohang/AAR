Many substantial geographic information systems (GIS) have been designed for use by expert users. As a result, non-expert users often find them difficult to use. This paper presents a framework to facilitate the use of such GIS by non-expert users. The framework achieves this by allowing the creation of vague visual queries which use data abstraction and relevance feedback to obtain a final result. The data abstraction model is dynamically updated to improve future query performance.
