This comes with the steady increase in Internet use for education, marketing and commercial trading, and in government for communication of information to citizens.

The model is a conceptual framework for Internet searching that will help people to overcome the challenges of working within an environment that is subject to continuous change, both in the forms of technology used and in the content that is available through the Internet.

Our model should prove valuable to educators, researchers and consultants to inform their own practice as well as for use in the educational environment
