In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates the statistical and structural information for unconstrained handwritten numeral recognition. This approach uses state-duration adapted transition probability to improve the modeling of state-duration in conventional HMMs and uses macro-states to overcome the difficulty in modeling pattern structures by HMMs. The proposed method is superior to conventional approaches in many aspects. In the statistical and structural models, the orientations are encoded into discrete codebooks and the distributions of locations are modeled by joint Gaussian distribution functions. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve high performance in terms of speed and accuracy.
