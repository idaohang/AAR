Mobile devices have received much research interest in re- cent years. Mobility raises new issues such as more dynamic context, limited computing resources, and frequent disconnections. To handle these issues, we propose a middleware, called 3DMA, which introduces three requirements, 1) distribution, 2) decoupling and 3) decomposition. 3DMA uses a space based middleware approach combined with a set of workers which are able to act on the users behalf either to reduce load on the mobile device, or to support disconnected behavior. In order to demonstrate aspects of the middleware architecture we consider the development of a commonly used mobile application.
