Australian governments have recently moved from cash accounting to accrual accounting. In doing so they have made simultaneous use of two rival accrual accounting frameworks: AAS 31 and GFS. AAS 31 and GFS operating result measures differ significantly. To date, the AAS 31 framework has enjoyed primacy. This paper evaluates these two frameworks, and suggests that GFS is superior. Accrual accounting has been accompanied at the national government level by the introduction of a new key fiscal policy measure: the â€˜fiscal balanceâ€™. This paper explains and evaluates this new fiscal measure. It concludes that, given the present fiscal policy of the Australian government, fiscal balance is a superior fiscal policy measure to the 'cash' budget balance measure which it replaced. However, from the alternative â€˜golden ruleâ€™ policy standpoint, fiscal balance is not a 1meaningful fiscal policy measureï£§although its stock counterpart, net financial liabilities, is.
