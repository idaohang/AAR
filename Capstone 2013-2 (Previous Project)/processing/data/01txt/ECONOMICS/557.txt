This statistical note examines trends in Australian banking and finance enrolments and student load, along with the  composition of enrolments and course completions, over the 1990s. Unpublished higher education statistics from the  Department of Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (DETYA) is extracted at the specific and broad field of study  level for the purposes of the analysis. Three main trends are noted. First, banking and finance courses are among the  fastest growing business-related fields in Australia. On average, enrolments in banking and finance courses increased  annually by some 17.94 percent over the period, with postgraduate enrolments growing at an annual rate of 32.34  percent, and undergraduate enrolments at 15.25 percent. Second, while the composition of banking and finance  enrolments has changed markedly during the last decade, female participation rates are lower than other businessrelated  fields. Female enrolments currently make up less than one third of all research students in banking and finance.  Finally, the share of enrolments by overseas and domestic fee-paying students has also increased. In 1998 only some  37.30 percent of banking and finance course completions were by non-fee-paying students, whereas in all businessrelated  programs this figure is slightly more than 60 percent.
