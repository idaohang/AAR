Each year QUTâ€™s Centre of Philanthropy and Nonprofit Studies collects and analyses statistics on the amount and extent of tax-deductible donations made and claimed by Australians in their individual income tax returns to deductible gift recipients (DGRs). The information presented in this working paper is based on the amount and type of tax-deductible donations made and claimed by Australian individual taxpayers to DGRs for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.
