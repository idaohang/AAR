This paper seeks to analyse a case in which firms choose to divide their R&amp;D expenditures into two components: competitive R&amp;D and Joint-Venture R&amp;D. The analysis is motivated by the fact that R&amp;D outputs can have different degrees of non-excludability. It is therefore reasonable to expect that a firm will allocate a part of its funds to competitive R&amp;D; this is the case in areas in which research is non-excludable to a smaller degree, and part of it to Joint-Venture R&amp;D, in cases where R&amp;D output is highly non-excludable. This issue is addressed in a three-stage model of a duopoly, in which joint-venture R&amp;D and competitive R&amp;D are chosen in the first and second stages while the quantity of the product is chosen in the third stage. The results confirm that allocation of expenditure to the joint-venture component increases as the spillover rate on the competitive component increases. Furthermore, if firms are able to coordinate their joint-venture R&amp;D levels, there is greater incentive to increase this allocation. However, for these results to obtain, it is crucial that the two types of R&amp;D are chosen sequentially; a simultaneous choice would lead to a corner solution in which only competitive R&amp;D is chosen.
