This study presents a model capturing sources of Australian aggregate labour productivity using  annual time series data from 1970 to 2001. Labour productivity, or real output per hour worked,  in this model is determined by real net capital stock in information technology and  telecommunications (ITT), real net capital stock in the non-ITT sector, trade openness, human  capital, the wage rate, international competitiveness, and the union membership rate. Given the  lack of long and consistent time series data, multivariate cointegration techniques are  inappropriate as the cointegration results will be sensitive to the lag length, the inclusion or  exclusion of the intercept term or a trend in the cointegration equation and/or the vector  autoregression (VAR) specification. Therefore, the Engle-Granger representation theorem and  the Hausman weak exogeneity test have been employed to determine the short and long-term  drivers of Australian productivity. Empirical estimates indicate that, in the long-term, policies  aimed at promoting various types of investment, trade openness, international competitiveness,  and the use of wage as an stimulant in a decentralised wage negotiation system, will improve  labour productivity. In the short term, all the above variables except for human capital and labour  reforms, which both need more time to evolve, determine productivity performance.
