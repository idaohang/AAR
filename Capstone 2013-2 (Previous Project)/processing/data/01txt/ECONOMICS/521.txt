In recent years Taylorâ€™s rule has become a widely used tool for assessing the stance of  monetary policy. Not only has it been used to evaluate the U.S. Federal Reserveâ€™s monetary  policy, but also, for example, to evaluate the appropriateness of the European Central Bankâ€™s  monetary policy for each individual member nation of the European Monetary Union. This  paper builds on this work and uses Taylorâ€™s rule to evaluate the degree of appropriateness of  Australiaâ€™s national monetary policy to each of Australiaâ€™s states and territories. National  monetary policy is represented by the overnight cash rate and this is compared to a notional  cash rate calculated for each individual state and territory. The aim is to illustrate the extent  to which national monetary policy historically may have deviated from what might have been  most appropriate for the economic conditions of each state and territory. To this end, three  different recent monetary policy episodes are analysed from a regional perspective.  Moreover, an analysis of the disparities between the Australian statesâ€™ and territoriesâ€™  notional cash rates with the actual national cash rate suggests â€“ perhaps not too surprisingly -  that the Reserve Bank of Australia implicitly sets national cash rates in close accordance with  the economic conditions of Australiaâ€™s two most populous states.
