This paper examines the system of â€˜accrual output budgetingâ€™ which was introduced by most Australian governments at the end of the 1990s. It explains the key features of the system, and its roots in â€˜marketâ€™ models. Key difficulties with the model are identified: including the unsuitability of many publicly-funded outputs to funding on a price-per-unit-of-output basis and the information problems which arise in determining the â€˜efficientâ€™ price of outputs .
