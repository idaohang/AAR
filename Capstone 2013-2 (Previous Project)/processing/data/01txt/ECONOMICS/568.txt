With the arrival of accrual accounting and a performance budgeting system known as &quot;accrual output budgeting&quot;, there have been huge changes in the mechanism of central financial control in the budget-dependent Australian public sector. This article outlines and evaluates these changes. The new parliamentary appropriations arrangements are discussed, as is the increased role played by non-appropriated departmental &quot;own-source&quot; funding. The commercialisation rationale of these changes is outlined. Consideration is given to their implications for fiscal transparency and democratic accountability.
