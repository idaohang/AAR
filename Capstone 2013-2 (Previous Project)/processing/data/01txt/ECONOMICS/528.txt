This paper analyses current government expenditure in Fiji using annual time series data for  the period 1969-1999. Alternative theories of government expenditure are reviewed and a  distinction is made between economic/apolitical determinants and institutional/political  determinants. Categorising the literature in this way suggests the application of non-nested  tests in empirical work. The first step is to estimate the two models separately. All four test  statistics for non-nested hypotheses lead to the conclusion of double rejection. A  parsimonious comprehensive model, encompassing both economic and institutional variables,  is preferred as it passes all diagnostic tests and involves the acceptance conclusion from  pairwise non-nested tests.
