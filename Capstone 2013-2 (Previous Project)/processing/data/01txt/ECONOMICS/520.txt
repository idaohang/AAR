This paper examines comovements between equity sectors across European markets during the post-euro  adoption period 1999-2002. The markets comprise six selected Member States of the European Union (EU):  namely, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland and Italy. The five sectors selected are classified according  to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). They include the consumer discretionary, consumer  staples, financial, industrials and materials sectors. Multivariate cointegration procedures, Granger-causality tests  and generalised variance decomposition analyses based on error-correction and vector autoregressive models are  conducted to examine long and short-run relationships among these markets. The results indicate that there are  few stationary long-run relationships between sectors in different markets, but many significant short-run causal  linkages between these sectors. Variance decomposition indicates that the consumer discretionary, financial and  materials sectors in the EU are relatively more integrated than the consumer staples and industrials sectors.  However, irrespective of the sector examined the large equity markets of France, Germany and Italy remain the  most influential in terms of causality and the proportion of variance accounted for by innovations in these same  markets.
