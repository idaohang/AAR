This paper examines the short and long-term price linkages among Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) equity markets over the period 1995 to 2000. Seven developed markets  (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and the United States) and  eleven emerging markets (China, Chile, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the  Philippines, Russia, Taiwan and Thailand) are included in the analysis. Multivariate  cointegration procedures, Granger-causality tests, level VAR and generalised variance  decomposition analyses based on error-correction and vector autoregressive models are  conducted to examine long and short-run relationships among these markets. The results  indicate that there is a stationary long-run relationship and significant short-run causal  linkages among the APEC equity markets. The results also indicate that the degree of  comovement and codependencies among APECâ€™s domestic and sub-regional markets varies  considerably. In general, Australasian, Northern Asian and South American markets are  relatively more influenced by domestic market conditions, North American markets relatively  more by regional factors and Southern Asian markets more strongly influenced by markets  outside either their own or geographical close domestic markets.
