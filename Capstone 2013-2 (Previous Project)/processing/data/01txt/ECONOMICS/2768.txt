Governments around the world are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of an efficient and effective Freight Logistics (FL) sector in promoting and sustaining regional and national economic performance. The role that FL can play in the environmental sustainability of the transport sector is also becoming more prominent given air quality and greenhouse gas implications of freight movements. In addition, there are serious constraints on levels of infrastructure provision required to meet projected future capacity bottlenecks.     FL activities in Australia make a very significant contribution to the nationâ€™s economic well being, as well as having a significant impact on environmental sustainability related outcomes. The FL sector is of vital importance in ensuring the competitiveness of all other economic sectors in what is increasingly a global economic and business environmental. The significance of the FL sector is forecast to increase substantially, with land based freight transport likely to experience rapid rates of growth. Such growth brings added pressure on the preservation and provision of infrastructure, as well as on urban congestion and environmental impacts. (eg: GHG, air and noise pollution).     Freight growth is rapid and road freight is growing at the expense of other modes. The total Australian freight task is estimated to double over the next 20 years. The road freight task in Queensland (expressed in million-tonne kilometres) is forecast to increase by 130% in the next 20 years.
