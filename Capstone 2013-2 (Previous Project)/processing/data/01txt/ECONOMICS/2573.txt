This paper examines two issues. First, it evaluates the statistical significance of a number of socioeconomic and demographic variables on the level of gambling-type expenditures in New South Wales, Australia. Factors analysed include household income, family composition, welfare status, gender, age, occupation and ethnicity. Second, the study examines the incidence of gambling-type expenditures, and hence taxation, on New South Walesâ€™ households. The study confirms similar findings overseas on the income regressivity of gambling expenditures. All other things being equal, Lotto and Instant Lotto are the most regressive of the major gambling products in their incidence on Australian households, and are certainly more regressive than comparable North American instruments.
