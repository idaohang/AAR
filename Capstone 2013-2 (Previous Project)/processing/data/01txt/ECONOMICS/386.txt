Those who have followed the debate between Drew and Noland (2000)2 and Hayes (2001) in this journal will understand that the controversy surrounding one of the most hotly contested ideas in financial economics â€“ market efficiency and fund manager skill â€“ is truly alive and well. Drew and Noland (2000) and Hayes (2001) are both in agreement that idea of a market which is efficient in an informational sense represents more than a clash of theory with practice, it is a debate which strikes at the heart of how Australiaâ€™s AUD 500 billion pool of retirement savings should be managed3. Hayes (2001) is partial to the view that the â€œAustralian equity market is not perfectly efficientâ€¿ and that â€œactive investment managers have been effectively exploiting these inefficiencies over the past 20 years.â€¿ The essence of Hayesâ€™ (2001) argument seems to be that contribution of Drew and Noland (2000) is limited as it employed a methodology that considered post MER returns. Hayes (2001) suggests that that the received practice for evaluation is â€œbased on raw data before fees and expensesâ€¿ and that â€œMERs are management and administrative charges which have no relevance to the managerâ€™s ability to outperform the index.â€¿ This reply offers an alternate view to Hayesâ€™ (2001) claim of irrelevance of the MER in assessing manager performance. Specifically, we provide evidence in this paper of the impact of fees on the performance of both retail and wholesale funds managing domestic equities on behalf of superannuation investors. Two decades after the publication of Bird, Chin, and McCraeâ€™s pioneering work  â€œSuperannuation fund managers â€“ how do they rate?â€¿ in the JASSA of 1982, we are still debating the skill (or otherwise) of fund managers and its implications for efficient capital markets.
