In Australia, as elsewhere, there has been a dramatic decline in the number of students undertaking undergraduate economics degrees during the 1990s. This applies equally to both specialised economics degree programs and more broadly based economics majors in  business degrees. For example, and in terms of specialised economics degrees, Millmow (1995) used a Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DETYA) survey of ten universities to conclude that the aggregate number of students enrolled fell by some 30 percent between 1991 and 1994. However, these official statistics only included students enrolled in the â€˜Bachelor of Economicsâ€™, rather than all degree programs which could be reasonably classified as an economics qualification.
