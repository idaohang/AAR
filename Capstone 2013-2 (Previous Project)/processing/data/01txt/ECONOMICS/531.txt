In this performance evaluation study, two questions are addressed. First, do active  fund managers possess macro and micro forecasting skills that deliver superior riskadjusted  returns? Second, what is the nature of market timing/stock selectivity trade  off in the generation of alpha? The answers from this study are as follows: as an  industry, managers delivered inferior returns for superannuation investors for the  period 1991 through 1999. The study provides little evidence that the Australian  funds management industry holds sufficient macro and/or micro forecasting abilities  to generate positive alpha. While previous research has found that inferior market  timing decisions are compensated for by superior stock selection skills, this study  finds no substantive inverse relationship between timing and selectivity.
