This paper demonstrates how the presence of a lower interest rate expectations detected in short-term interest rate futures during the 1990â€™s allowed arbitrage profits when trading intracommodity spread differentials on the Sydney Futures Exchangeâ€™s 90 Day Bank Accepted Bill futures contract. Famaâ€™s (1970) hypothesis on market efficiency cannot be accepted for the test period as statistically significant gross profits were generated by a naÃ¯ve strategy. The EMH had greater predictive power once transactions costs were deducted. Furthermore, the EMH remained unable to be accepted after the allowance of generous transaction costs.
