Some views on Housing  Average pay wonâ€™t buy standard home1.  Strategic home investment can generate more wealth than could possibly be earned through employment2.  A bad end to the boom would mark the failure of the separation between monetary policy and prudential regulation introduced after the report of the Wallis committee. The whole program of financial deregulation would be called into question3.  So we know that the present housing boom in Australia will - almost certainly - be followed by a housing bust. After that bust, the smart league - including most of the banks - will soldier on with their pockets stuffed but many, especially in the middle-income and poorer brigade, will be in thrall to the banks through crippling mortgage payments for years to come4.
