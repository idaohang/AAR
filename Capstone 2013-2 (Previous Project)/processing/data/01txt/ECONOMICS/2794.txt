Despite the fact that there are strong  a priori grounds for presuming that the intergovernmental grants characteristic of fiscal federalism in Australia may generate fiscal illusion, no empirical effort has been directed at this line of inquiry.  The present article seeks to go at least some way towards remedying this deficiency by evaluating the flypaper variant of the fiscal illusion hypothesis using a time series analysis of Australian Commonwealth expenditures for 1981 to 1992.  The results of these estimations provide some tentative empirical support for the existence of a flypaper effect on public expenditure in Australia for the period under review.
