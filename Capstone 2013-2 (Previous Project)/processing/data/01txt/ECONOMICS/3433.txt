Current media attention on policy about Indigenous people has largely focused  on the plight of rural and remote Indigenous communities and has centred  around two main areas: land and economic well-being. The second dimension  defines the Indigenous person as an economically rational being seeking to  maximise individual benefit and share costs across the community. Policy  options based on individual wealth maximising behaviour and rational self  interested actions may serve to explain economic growth in the dominant  culture of developed countries but is less useful in other contexts. We argue  that assumptions inherent in capitalist policies are unlikely to mesh with  traditional Aboriginal settings.  Capitalist enterprises establish labour contracts founded on notions of individual  self interest that may conflict with cultural community responsibilities and  expression of identity. Individual identity in community and connection to place  may undermine the motivational assumptions of free market solutions. Where  norms and social interactions are important policy options should explicitly  consider ownership structures and property relations.  Cooperatives as a form of organisation offer the potential for economic  development initiatives to align with the sociological and citizenship features of  Indigenous communities. We propose that business can be structured so that it  meets collective needs, operates to develop a competitive advantage from its  cultural base, and competes in a western socio-economic dominant market.  Explicit consideration can and should be given to the culturally evolving  landscape in remote Indigenous communities. Policy alternatives incorporating  traditional conceptions of citizenship offer some prospect for discontinuing  colonialist legacies.
