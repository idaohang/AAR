In this asset pricing study, three questions are addressed. First, does the multifactor model of Fama and French  (1993) capture returns in Asian stock markets in a meaningful manner? Second, do small firms and high bookto-  market equity firms carry a risk premia? Third, can competing hypotheses (such as survivorship bias, datasnooping  and irrationality) explain the multifactor model results? The answers from this study are as follows:  The multifactor model of Fama and French (1993) provides a parsimonious description of the cross-section of  returns, with the relationship between firm size, book-to-market equity and average stock returns being robust  for Asian markets over the 1990s. We find that small firms and high book-to-market equity firms carry a risk  premia, providing opportunities for mean-variance efficient investors. Finally, our findings reject the claim that  the results of multifactor model can be explained by competing hypotheses for the Asian experience.
