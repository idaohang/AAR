This paper examines the transmission of spot electricity prices and price volatility among the five Australian  electricity markets in the National Electricity Market (NEM): namely, New South Wales (NSW), Queensland  (QLD), South Australia (SA), the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme (SNO) and Victoria (VIC). A  multivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) model is used to identify the  source and magnitude of spillovers. The results indicate the presence of positive own mean spillovers in only a small  number of markets and no mean spillovers between any of the markets. This appears to be directly related to the  limitations of the present system of regional interconnectors. Nevertheless, the large number of significant ownvolatility  and cross-volatility spillovers in all five markets indicates the presence of strong ARCH and GARCH  effects. Contrary to evidence from studies in North American electricity markets, the results also indicate that  Australian electricity spot prices are stationary.
