Davis, Fama and French (2000) report that the value premium in United Statesâ€™ stocks is robust. Herein, we  present out-of-sample evidence for Malaysia, finding that value stocks outperform growth stocks and  document an arbitrage opportunity. We observe that the mean monthly returns are substantially higher for  the two mimic portfolios (SMB and HML) when compared with the market portfolio. For the period 1991  through 1999, an investor generated 1.92% (annually) holding the market portfolio in Malaysia, compared  with the two mimic portfolios, SMB and HML with returns of 17.70% and 17.69% respectively. We also  observe that the standard deviations for the two mimic portfolios are significantly lower than the standard  deviation of the market portfolio. Moreover, the findings presented in this study reject the notion of  survivorship bias advanced by Kothari, Shanken and Sloan (1995) and the data-snooping hypothesis  attributed to Black (1993) and Mackinlay (1995) as an explanation for the value premium.
