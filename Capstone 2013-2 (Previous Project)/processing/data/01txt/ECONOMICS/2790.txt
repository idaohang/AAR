This paper examines the empirical analysis of the five main hypotheses subsumed under the generic term fiscal illusion.  After placing these hypotheses within a common theoretical framework, the paper attempts to evaluate empirical research into the revenue-complexity hypothesis, the revenue-elasticity hypothesis, the flypaper effect, renter illusion, and debt illusion.
