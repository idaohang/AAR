Under the Australian superannuation system there are two compulsory contributions to superannuation funds made on behalf of employees. The first is the award superannuation contribution of three per cent of wage or salary arising from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commissionâ€™s decision in 1988 to pay wage increases as superannuation. The second is the Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC), introduced in 1992, which requires employers to pay a specified proportion of wage and salary (eight per cent from July 2000) into a superannuation fund. Contributions under award superannuation are paid to the superannuation fund specified in the award while the SGC is paid to a fund chosen by the employer.
