This paper examines financing and investment structures in the film, television, and music industries of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China and Latin America.

Likewise, creators, producers, and distributors are increasingly targeting lucrative international markets, particularly culturally and linguistically proximate communities. However, while government policies can assist in domestic growth and in facilitating exports, it is synergy between financial and creative inputs into production, distribution, and marketing that determines success or failure.
