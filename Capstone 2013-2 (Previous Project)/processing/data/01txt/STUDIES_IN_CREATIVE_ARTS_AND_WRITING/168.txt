In this paper I will present some perspectives on compositional engagement which have arisen from my PhD study into composition processes with computers. I believe that while the specific tasks and outcomes of making music with computers might be different from another medium, such as paper or piano, the composerâ€™s engagement is fundamentally similar.  The main point I wish to make is that compositional engagement is multifaceted. There are a range of ways in which composers interact with musical materials and mediums. I refer to these as modes of compositional engagement. A composer works in different modes depending upon the stage the composition is at, the type of material they are working with, the compositional methods they are using, and the medium in which they are working. A composer might work predominantly in one particular mode of compositional engagement, change between modes quickly, or display features of different modes concurrently
