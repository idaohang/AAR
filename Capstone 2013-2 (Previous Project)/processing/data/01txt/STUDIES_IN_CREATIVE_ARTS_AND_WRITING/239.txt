Since 2000, we have developed and taught a course at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia: KWB370 â€“ Electronic Creative Writing. The course has run in each first semester (February-July) since then, as part of the undergraduate Creative Writing degree and is now offered to postgraduate students as well. The course was developed partly in response to demands for more technological literacy skills to be embedded in key courses across the university, but a more significant motivation was the our desire to embrace, represent, and contribute to the then still-emergent genre of literary hypertext as a valid and viable option for writers both as creative artists and industry professionals. This desire was also in line with our home facultyâ€™s re-orientation from a Faculty of Arts to a Creative Industries Faculty, which includes a strong interest in professionally relevant graduate outcomes and with QUTâ€™s overall focus on providing its students with skills useful outside academia.
