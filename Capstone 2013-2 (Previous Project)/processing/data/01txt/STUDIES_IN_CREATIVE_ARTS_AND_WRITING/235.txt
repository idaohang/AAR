Tertiary journalism students have had a smorgasbord of work experience opportunities at major sporting events over the past couple of years. But for many - especially those who volunteered for the Sydney 2000 Olympics - the experience was one of disappointment. This paper chronicles some of the major work experience opportunities afforded students in recent times and concludes that a more productive arrangement with event organisers looking for willing helpers from journalism schools need to be put in place to avert disappointing student journalists looking for â€œreal journalism experienceâ€¿.
