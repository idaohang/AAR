The idea of teaching art with young children can evoke much discussion and debate about the value of art, its place in society and schools, and how it is best taught.  Some people think that to teach art 'properly', all you need to do is provide an attractive array of materials, a safe environment, be a warm and loving person, and ensure that the children are &quot;having fun&quot;.  Many exemplary teachers and artists insist that they do not teach art with young children â€“ they argue that art comes from the children, that the children simply explore, experiment, and express themselves. However, a close examination of these teachers' and artists' practices invariably shows them guiding, modelling, demonstrating skills and techniques, providing children with opportunities to practise and master skills, organising, and enacting teaching in any number of ways.  Even so, they donâ€™t like to think or speak of their work as teaching.  The work of these teachers and artists is described ironically as teaching, without teaching (McArdle, 2001).
