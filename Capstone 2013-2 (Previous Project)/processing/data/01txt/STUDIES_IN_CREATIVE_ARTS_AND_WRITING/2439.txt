This paper examines three television dramas directed by the Chinese director Feng Xiaogang during the 1990s. These are Beijingers in New York (1993), Chicken Feathers (1994) and The Dark Side of the Moon (1997). The principal argument is that the three can be read as indicative of new modalities of freedom, expressed respectively as ambition, hope and desire. The serials also articulate a number of moral dilemmas facing intellectuals who contemplate a career in business.
