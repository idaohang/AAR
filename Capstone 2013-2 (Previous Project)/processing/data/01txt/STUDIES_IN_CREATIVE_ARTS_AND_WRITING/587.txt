How can we most usefully appropriate the rhetorics of the new economy to advance a contemporary understanding of the production and consumption of creative and informational content? Can the concept of creativity be broadened, but not so much that it becomes everything and nothing â€“ the newest business lit fad and just as ephemeral as the rest â€“ such that claims for its role as a driver of economic growth can be sustained? Can the analytical and research context for â€˜experientialâ€™ or â€˜culturalâ€™ consumption â€“ core business for cultural, communications and media studies academics be helpfully developed through new economy models? This piece takes an explicitly policy orientated line and tendentiously tracks a genealogy and some possible preferred futures for the creative industries beyond their framing within a cultural policy problematic. I track the fate of creative and informational content as it passes across three grids of understanding: â€˜cultureâ€™, â€˜servicesâ€™ and â€˜knowledgeâ€™. These grids also serve as historical and/or possible rationales for state intervention in the creative industries as well as industryâ€™s own understandings of their nature and role.
