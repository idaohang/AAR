The current information environment presents many new challenges for Library Technicians, both professionally and personally.  The speed of changes in the workplace often makes if difficult to pause and reflect on what all these changes really mean in our working and personal lives.  With the focus on understanding the needs of our clients so that we can deliver improved services, we should not overlook the need to understand what we already have to offer as individuals and how we can further develop ourselves to meet the diverse challenges we face.    Mentoring has long been recognised as providing valuable opportunities for personal and professional growth.  In the context of Bridging Services: embracing reality, therefore, there has never been a better time to explore the potential for mentoring in the library and information sector.  A mentoring program can offer a relationship of support and understanding which effectively adds a personal dimension to career development.  ALIAâ€™s Mentoring Program in Queensland is making a significant contribution to the development of a highly trained workforce in the library and information sector, with a strong commitment to high quality standards.     This paper highlights the specific benefits for Library Technicians who engage in mentoring, including the opportunities to develop new networks, enhance communication skills and fast track skill development.  Research currently being undertaken to better understand the personal and professional learning outcomes of both mentors and mentees is presented, as well as guidance on how Library Technicians can join the upcoming ALIA program.
