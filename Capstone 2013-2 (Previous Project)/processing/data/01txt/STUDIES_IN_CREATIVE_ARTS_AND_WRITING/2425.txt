1 Introduction  1.1 Background and Objective  'Creative industries' is a new term in academic, policy and industry communication. It captures new economy dynamics which older categorisations like 'the arts', 'media' and 'cultural industries' did not. This project â€“ Queenslandâ€™s Creative Industries Cluster Mapping &amp; Value Chain Analysis â€“ has been undertaken to help advance the conceptualisation of creative industries, and to assist policy makers and industry by analysing creative industriesâ€™ dynamics and value to the Queensland economy. Significantly, it highlights the integrated value chain relationships that exist between  industries rather than concentrating on the 'silo' constructions of individual industry sectors.  The creative industries cluster mapping and value chain analysis has been commissioned and led by the Creative Industries Research &amp; Applications Centre (CIRAC) within the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). CIRAC has administered the research for this project as part of its mission to contribute to the research and applications needs of the creative industries locally, at a state level, nationally and internationally.  This report presents data that will assist industry partners in developing informed economic and cultural development strategies. By developing a better understanding of the scale and dynamics of creative industries in Queensland, the Creative Industries Cluster Mapping and Value Chain Analysis can inform the continual development of appropriate government policy that assists all businesses within and supporting the creative industries.  In short, by enhancing the collective knowledge and understanding of the creative industries, the project outcomes will help inform policy planning, research priorities and investment strategies.
