In this thesis I wish to examine the ways in which several Australian choreographers have explored a variety of possible relationships between music and dance in their work. By examining their work and ideas I will show how they have each individually met the  hallenge offered by modern dance by finding new relationships between the two art forms.  I will focus on four Australian choreographers - Helen Herbertson, Don Asker, Beth Shelton and Sue Healey. Although these choreographers represent a fairly small cross section of the world of contemporary dance in Australia, I feel that their work reveals a diversity of approaches. On the basis of personal interviews with the choreographers about their work and an examination of other materials ( videos, program notes. etc.) I will discuss how they, as choreographers, perceive the 'role' of music and how they incorporate it into their work.
