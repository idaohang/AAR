Sticky.net.au is an online network of young people that enables content sharing, distribution and collaborations alongside various other forms of communication. Sticky has been developed at Queensland University of Technology, Australia as the online platform for the Youth Internet Radio Network (YIRN), a research project funded by the Australian Research Council, Arts Queensland, the State Governmentâ€™s Office of Youth, Brisbane City Council and QMusic, the peak body for the contemporary music industry in Queensland. Stickyâ€™s audio streaming and archive capabilities can be seen as an experiment in &quot;Internet radio&quot;. We explore where technological innovation fits in with the development of radio and in this context will explore related issues of control, access and regulation.
