The Ecology of Queensland Design project is part of the three year Mapping  Queenslandâ€™s Creative Industries which has been undertaken by the Creative  Industries Research and Applications Centre within the Queensland University of  Technologyâ€™s Faculty of Creative Industries. The report examines the nature,  employment, size and impact of the design industries to the Queensland economy. It  provides a context for Queenslandâ€™s design ecology in the light of the broader  Australian situation and with overseas studies.
