What do Fern Gully, Human Nature, Antarctica, Cane Toads, Sea Change, Walking on Water, The Life Series, Sacred Sex, and Spike Milligan all have in common? All were created by screen industry entrepreneurs who live and operate out of the Northern Rivers region of NSW, Australia. Wayne Young, John Weiley, Mark Lewis, Deb Cox, Roger Monk, Catherine Marciniak, Cynthia Connop and Cathy Henkel are all successful screen industry practitioners operating out of the region and are part of a dynamic and growing sector that is gaining national and international interest.               IMAGINING THE FUTURE 2: Screen and Creative Industries in the Northern Rivers region reveals that the region now has a critical mass of creative talent and is increasingly attracting experienced, networked professionals and entrepreneurs from other regions and cities. They are arriving in growing numbers, captivated by the rich cultural life of the region, the landscapes and the buzz that the region has already generated. They are bringing ideas, disposable capital and access to investment and there is ample evidence that this growth trend is likely to continue.         The Northern Rivers region is on the north east coast of NSW, Australia and covers the area from Grafton to Tweed Heads and west to the Great Divide, comprising seven local council areas. This study builds upon and extends research conducted in 2000 (Imagining the Future) which identified an active and growing creative industries sector and a significant number of experienced and credited screen industry producers (Henkel, 2000). In 2004, the Northern Rivers Regional Development Board (NRRDB) began developing a Regional Industry and Economic Plan (RIEP) as the basis for determining priorities for regional economic development and managing projected population growth over the next 25 years. The RIEP identified creative industries as one of ten priority areas for growth in the region. In that context, NRRDB decided to collaborate with Queensland University of Technology in a new study of screen and creative industries in the Northern Rivers region referred to in this report as the Northern Rivers 2005 study.         The study found a total of 7,280 people actively engaged in creative industries in the region which is 6.1% of the region?s labour force. This represents a growth of more than 100% since 2000 when 3,500 people were identified as working in creative industries comprising 4.1% of the local work force (Henkel 2000).  In December 2005, there were over 2,500 individuals or sole traders and 458 mainly micro-businesses engaged in creative industry activity. Approximately 70% of all people working in this sector classify themselves as self-employed.         The economic value of creative industries is estimated to be $190 million and the screen industry sector to be $40 million. A survey of 18 experienced producers revealed project budgets during 2005 of over $7 million and projected budgets for the coming 12 months of $27.8 million. Incoming productions utilising locations in the region contributed an additional $8.1 million into the region?s economy in 2005 and employed 233 local practitioners.         The local industry, comprising senior practitioners and local industry organisations, have taken the lead and shown their commitment in building this sector to its current level. What is now needed is a commitment from all levels of government to collaborate with the local industry to implement the proposed strategies and collectively to create the preferred future outlined in this report.
