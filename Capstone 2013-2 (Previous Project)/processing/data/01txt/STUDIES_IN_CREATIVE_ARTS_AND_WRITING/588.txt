The paper will present a rationale for distinguishing between notions of cultural and creative industries which have implications for theory, industry and policy analysis. I do this from the standpoint of a researcher and analyst and also from a position of a corporate involvement in a substantial project to grow and diversify a regional economy  through the development of its creative industries. This is a 'creative industries precinct' in inner suburban Brisbane involving my university, QUT, the Queensland state government through its Department of State Development, and a variety of industry players, and retail and property developers. There is theoretical purchase in distinguishing the two terms, in part to put further flesh on the bones of claims about the nature of the knowledge-based economy and its relation to culture and creativity. Shifts in the nature of the industries usually described by the terms also need to be captured effectively, as are different policy regimes that come into play as regulation of and support for cultural and creative industries.
