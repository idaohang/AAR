We live under the enduring shadow of ecological crisis. Contemporary theorists have suggested that this â€˜problem of ecologyâ€™ indicates a more general crisis of human subjectivity. Having observed much new media art praxis operates largely without awareness of the ecological implications of those practices I began developing new processes for conceptualising and developing media art works which I termed â€˜Ecosophicalâ€™. My objective was to discover whether such works could be used to create contexts within which participants might reflect upon connections between the â€˜problem of ecologyâ€™ and the proposed problem of human subjectivity.
