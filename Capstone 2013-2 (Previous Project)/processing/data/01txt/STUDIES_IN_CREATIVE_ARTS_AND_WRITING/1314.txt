This paper discusses community-based media and ICTs for poverty reduction, with a focus on issues of â€˜voiceâ€™. The paper will explore and unpack the notion of â€˜voiceâ€™, considering the potential of such a concept to advance our thinking about the broader area of ICTs and poverty, particularly at community level. Following an introductory section which sets out the background to the discussion and interrogates â€˜voiceâ€™ as a useful concept for development, I explore three aspects of ICTs and poverty from three different understandings of the potential role of â€˜voiceâ€™. Firstly I explore local content creation and through this discuss the implications for â€˜voice povertyâ€™ individual freedoms, wellbeing and capabilities. Secondly I explore â€˜voiceâ€™ in terms of research methods, monitoring and evaluation and impact assessment. Is there a new agenda for impact assessment that will promote participatory methods? Finally I explore issues of access and use, the benefits of mixing media and the potential for advocacy â€“ that is, having a voice and being heard.
