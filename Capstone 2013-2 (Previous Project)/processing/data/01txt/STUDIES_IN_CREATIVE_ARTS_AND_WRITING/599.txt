This paper considers debates about creativity and creatvie industries in light of three issues: (1) emergent knowledge production frameworks, and how cultural studies is positioned in relation to them; (2) the relationship of cultural studies academics to developments in creative industries fields, most notably the rise of cultural enterprise; and (3) the question of how conceptual frameworks are related to empirical developments in creative labour markets. It also critically explores the concepts of creative enterprise and cultural entrepreneurship.
