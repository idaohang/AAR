More than ever, the media dominate public life and shape public perceptions.  At the same time, the rise of digital technologies means that demarcations  between different forms of media are fading. Radio can be heard on an iPod,  data accompanies television programs, and news snippets are available on  mobile phones.  The Media and Communications in Australia offers a systematic introduction  to this dynamic and often bewildering field. Fully updated and revised to take  account of recent developments, this second edition outlines the key media  industries and explains how communications technologies are impacting on  them. It provides a thorough overview of the main approaches taken in studying  the media, and examines the thorny issues of media ethics, youth media, the  mediaâ€™s role in celebrity culture and the future of public broadcasting.  With contributions from some of Australiaâ€™s best researchers and teachers in  the field, The Media and Communications in Australia is the most comprehensive  and reliable introduction to media and communications available. It is an ideal  student text, and a reference for teachers of media and anyone interested in  this influential industry.  ***  Stuart Cunningham is Professor of Media and Communications at Queensland  University of Technology and Director of the Australian Research Council  Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation.
