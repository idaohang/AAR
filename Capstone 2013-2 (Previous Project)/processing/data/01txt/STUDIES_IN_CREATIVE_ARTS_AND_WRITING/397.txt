Despite countless warnings over past decades we continue to carve away the life support systems that we and our future generations depend upon. We live under the enduring mantle of a global crisis, a self-imposed act of unparalleled and seemingly irrational self-destruction which we misname as ecological â€“ we are the crisis. Numerous contemporary theorists have suggested that this 'problem of ecology' indicates a crisis of human subjectivity and agency linked to a fundamental problem in how we image ourselves within the world.  Having observed how much new media art praxis operates largely without awareness of the homo-ecological implications of those practices I began developing new processes for conceptualising and developing media art works to which I applied the term 'ecosophical'. My objective was to discover whether such works could be used to create contexts within which participants might reflect upon connections between the â€˜problem of ecologyâ€™ and the proposed problem of humanity/human subjectivity. To demonstrate this I introduce the history and context for ecosophical praxis and describe a project under development, Intimate Transactions (Shifting Dust). I conclude by suggesting new directions for other artists interested in engaging with this type of praxis.
