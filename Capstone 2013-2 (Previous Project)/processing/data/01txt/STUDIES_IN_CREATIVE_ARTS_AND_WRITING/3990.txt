Australia, as the worldâ€™s smallest continent and largest island, is characterised by diversity. Our people are as diverse as the landscape. Similarly our dance, apart from the strong Indigenous presence, began as a migrant culture. Australian dance has always been receptive to other influences. The two-way exchange and focus on Europe and North America has, in recent years, been balanced by mainly independent, rather than company, dancers who have seen Asia as the place to seek new influences and connections. Sophisticated technology and the resulting cultural globalisation has impacted on dance practice around the world. Despite the challenges facing Australian dance in the 21st century, new modes of practice, new relational possibilities and a continuing outward focus to connect with the region and beyond are some ways to ensure its relevance and survival in the foreseeable future.
