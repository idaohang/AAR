The beginning of the new millennium has proven to be a turbulent time for the traditional British rock music press. The closure of Melody Maker, which Frith (1983) calls the oldest magazine of its kind (166), was followed closely by the closure of Select, a monthly title that had concentrated on what has come to be known as the â€˜indieâ€™ market since its inception in 1990. As recently as July of 2001, Kingsize, a magazine launched in March of the same year, was shelved permanently. So what is going wrong in the UK?    This paper takes as its premise that the problems being faced by the music press in the UK results from the loss of a niche audience that can be understood as having evolved around the genre of alternative or â€˜indieâ€™ music.
