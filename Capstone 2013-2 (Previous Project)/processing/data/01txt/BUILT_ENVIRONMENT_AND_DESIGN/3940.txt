Kerznerâ€™s Level 2 assessment tool was used, which basically assesses maturity levels throughout the various phases of an organizationâ€™s project management life cycle.  This study compare maturity of current situation and expectation of 70 respondents working in 6 different types of organizations in Indonesia.   Differences were identified between types of organisations, with Financial Institutions, Consultants and Manufacturers belonging to a group with the higher of the current maturity scores, with the Consultants, Manufacturers and Service Providers belonging to a group with the higher of the expected future maturity scores.  However, there were no significant differences between the results for the various stages of the project life cycle.  The results indirectly confirm that the organisations of the participants of the survey are less effective/ excellent than they could be.
