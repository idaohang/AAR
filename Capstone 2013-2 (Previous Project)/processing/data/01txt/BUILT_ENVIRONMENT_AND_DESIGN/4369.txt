METU Solar House was originally designed and constructed as an active system in 1975. Water heated up by the collectors placed on sloped roof was stored in the storage tank and pumped to the heaters of the building. Due to some problems, the building was not used for years after the experiments were completed. In 1992 it was decided to convert the existing building to a well insulated hybrid one with a greenhouse. In the new design the entire roof is planned to be the built-in  air collector. The heated air collected by ducts can be pumped into the interior when the inside tempreture is below the comfort level. Then this heated air can be directed to the ducts within the floor and the heat can be stored for the evening. The passive solar heating element is mainly the greenhouse with various operable windows, which can be used for passively directing the warm air for heating or ventilating purposes.
