Analysis of the difference between the lowest and second lowest bids, or bid-spread, in a â€˜lowest winsâ€™ auction is of possible value in strategic bidding; providing an indication of mistakes in bids; determining a justifiable amount of bid security; and a means of providing some insight into the consequences of non-traditional auction arrangements.  Bid-spread analysis, as developed in this paper, provides some explanations concerning the nature of bids and their statistical properties.  In particular, it is shown here that, through the analysis of a data set of Hong Kong bidding data, that the bid-spread is directly (lineally) proportional to the contract size value.  The percentage bid-spread is found to be a function of the number of bidders and the lower order statistics of the uniform density function.
