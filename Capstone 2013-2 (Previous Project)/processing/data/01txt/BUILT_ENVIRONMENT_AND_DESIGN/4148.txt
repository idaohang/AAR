Contractorsâ€™ performance, amongst other things, has been associated with the high cost of public housing in Papua New Guinea.  Given that small indigenous contractors undertake construction of all public housing, this paper investigates the performance of small indigenous contractors.    Eight likely factors that affect small indigenous contractors' performance are identified from the literature.  An empirical study is then described aimed at determining how these factors affect project cost, time and quality.  This comprised a survey conducted in Port Moresby by personally administered questionnaires to a sample of small indigenous contractors to assess the level of factors associated with the problem of lack of performance.  Additionally, the view of each firm concerning the effect of each factor on performance was also obtained.  The results show that, with the exception of culture, all the factors are perceived to have an effect of construction performance.  It is also shown that the incidence of these factors, within the firms surveyed, are quite low.  Of particular concern is the level of cash flow.
