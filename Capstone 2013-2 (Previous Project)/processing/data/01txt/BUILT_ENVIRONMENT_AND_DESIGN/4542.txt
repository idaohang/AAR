This paper reports on a pilot study underÂ¬taken by the authors for the Royal InstituÂ¬tion of Chartered Surveyors EducaÂ¬tional Trust aimed at developing a method of automatic pricing of bills of quantities.    A method using a system of multipliers is described for Concrete Work and based on the rates contained in Laxton's 1989 buildÂ¬ing price book [4].  When tested on three 'live' bills of quantities, the method was found to be within one percent and six percent of the price book for larger projecÂ¬ts and smaller projects respectively, and within 1.25 percent for the aggregated bills.
