Many construction industry sectors have been experiencing chronic problems such as poor safety, inferior working conditions and insufficient quality. These problems have been identified as factors that affect constructionâ€™s productivity and will affect companyâ€™s performance. This paper investigates factors influencing construction productivity in Indonesia. Data was collected through questionnaires and personal interviews targeting non-residential building and infrastructure projects. Key factors influencing construction productivity and their causes were obtained through a series of statistical analyses based on the contracting companiesâ€™ approach. The findings suggest that the key factors and their causes were influenced by three issues: (1) characteristics of contractors; (2) inadequate management strategy; and (3) organisationâ€™s focus. A conceptual model of factors influencing construction productivity was developed to provide the contractors with information on which factors they need to focus. In addition, five alternative solutions are recommended to be applied on-site to achieve the best outcome of contractorsâ€™ performance.
