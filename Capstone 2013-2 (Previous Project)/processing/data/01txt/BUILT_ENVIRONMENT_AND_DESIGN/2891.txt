This paper reflects upon the development of a suite of new design, urban development, and engineering courses at the Queensland University of Technology. It describes the theoretical framework upon which these courses are founded, the systems applied to their development and documentation, and the broader pedagogical and structural implications and opportunities. The recent restructuring of the Faculty of Built Environment and Engineering has seen a faculty undergoing major shifts in its priorities and its intra-faculty relationships; a process that has seen the works of Ernest Boyer and Burton Clark provide theoretical framework for the shaping of the facultyâ€™s future. One of the more significant features of that projected future is a new suite of student focused undergraduate courses. That is to say, courses in which the student takes a greater lead in the shaping of their own education. This paper outlines the process and results of the design and development activities that have sought to embed student focused goals within the new courses.
