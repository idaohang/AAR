What is ergonomics and why should designers care? Ergonomics is an approach that tries to adapt things to suit people rather than the reverse. Giving a high priority to the wellbeing of the people who use an object or place is commonly known as a user-centred design philosophy, a term that is used more often than it is thought about. It implies that designers first and foremost design things to make peopleâ€™s lives better and that motivations of personal expression and preference must come second. However many designers pay little attention to ergonomics in practice. Ultimately wether or not these steps are taken depends on the collective will of the profession and how much it values the people it serves. If designers are not user advocates in the design process who will be?
