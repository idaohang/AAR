The risks of failure of construction joint ventures (JVs) are high and the financial consequences are expensive.  This paper sets out to identify the nature of these risks and the means by which they are managed, through the study of the critical factors that contribute to successful JVs and the risk factors associated with JV operations.  The results of a survey of JV participants in Singapore are presented.  These indicate the overall risk factors facing contractors, the risk management measures that are felt to be effective, and the critical success factors involved at different stages of the project.
