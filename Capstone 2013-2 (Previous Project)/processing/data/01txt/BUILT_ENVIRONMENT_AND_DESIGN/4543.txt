This paper traces the origin, and motivations for use, of partnering in the Australian construction industry.  The issue of using the methodology in the industry is examined in relation to the 'vicious-circle' of adversarial behaviours and disputes that it is intended to break.  Here it is argued that the continual tension brought about by competitive bidding has created to a culture akin to the 'law of the jungle', leading to a lack of trust and communication between those involved and hence to poor relationships and adversarial attitudes and disputes, and this in turn has led to an even greater use of competitive bidding procurement by clients as a means of mitigating the resulting damage - thus maintaining a self-supportive and never-ending vicious circle of problems and disputes.  Finally, a small empirical study is described aimed at ascertaining the degree of acceptance and use of partnering, and its success or otherwise to date.  The study provided a reported success rate of over 95 percent and an overwhelming majority of contractors willing to use the methodology.
