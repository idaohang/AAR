In an attempt to bring the unique talents of various construction industry project participants together in a more productive and integrated manner, the Online Remote Construction Management (ORCM) project commenced in July 1999 proposing to test, field trial and/or evaluate the implementation of various Internet-based Construction Project Management (ICPM) systems and information and communication technologies (ICT) on five case study projects over a two-year period. This paper provides final results, findings and recommendations obtained after two years of research, surveying and benchmarking activities on one of the five ORCM case study projects. â€˜Critical Success Factorsâ€™ are identified offering a positive contribution to the successful implementation of ICT tools and ICPM systems on remote construction projects. Similar research activities were undertaken on the other four ORCM case study projects and will be considered in future papers.
