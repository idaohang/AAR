This note is a comment on Chinyio, E.A., Olomolaiye, P.O., Kometa, S.T. and Harris, F.C. (1998) A needs based methodology for classifying construction clients and selecting contractors, Construction Management and Economics, 16(10), 91-8, which describes research aimed at classifying clients by their needs rather than by the traditional public-private-developer approach.  The paper also proposes a new method of selecting contractors by matching clients' needs to contractors' ability to satisfy them.  The note offers constructive criticism of some aspects of the analysis.
