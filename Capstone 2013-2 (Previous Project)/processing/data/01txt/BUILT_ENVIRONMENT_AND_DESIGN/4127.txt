The casual nature of employment in the construction industry makes planning human asset requirements a vague exercise.  Human resource information systems (HRISs) offer a means of coping with these problems through improvements in the reliability, accuracy and accessibility of the human resources (HR) information.  Aimed at improving the understanding of construction HRISs, interviews were carried out with three leading construction companies in Australia.  The HR needs of the companies were examined by identifying the HR related functions and activities conducted, the internal and external users of HR information, the type of data needed, and the specific purpose of those data.  Twenty-three HR activities were identified and grouped into seven major functions: project management and control, strategic planning, review and analysis, employee profile, employee performance, human resource development, payroll and accounting support, and information systems outside the company.  The HR information for each function was established.  The findings of this study may facilitate the development of a HRIS for construction companies.
