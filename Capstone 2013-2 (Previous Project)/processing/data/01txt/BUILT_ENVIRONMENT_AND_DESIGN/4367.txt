The main objective of the study is to analyze the design parameters of mass-housing for finding out their effect on heating energy demand and solar heating. The analyzed parameters for mass-housing are spacing between the buildings, the dimensions and materials of the buildings, the geometry and its orientations, the size of windows and its orientation. Within the framework of the study, it also aimed at supplying a &quot;guide&quot; to the city parameters and designers. The &quot;guide&quot;, containing samples of differant configurations of the settlement, may provide them alternatives so that they can make comparison within the samples and their designs. Each sample representing a change in a parameter gives the designer an idea how such parameters affect the heating energy demand. A mass-housing district at Ankara, capital of Turkey, is selected for the case study due to its large number of mass-housing applications and easy data collection.
