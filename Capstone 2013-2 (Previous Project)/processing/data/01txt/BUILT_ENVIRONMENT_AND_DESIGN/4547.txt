Raftery (1993) has suggested that project cost estimates be presented in the form of cumulative probability functions (Raftery Curves) rather than the current practice of single point estimates.  This paper compares the Raftery Curves derived empirically for ten data sets gathered throughout the world.  The most consistent feature of all the curves was found to be the shift associated with to the number of bidders entering bids for contracts.  This is examined both in terms of bias and consistency.  Contrary to some previous studies, no evidence was found of any trends related to the value size of projects.
