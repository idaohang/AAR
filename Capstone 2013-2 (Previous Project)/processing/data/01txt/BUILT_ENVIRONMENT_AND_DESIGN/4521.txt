Since Friedman, fundamental research in construction contract bidding and estimating has been concerned with the full problem definition, formulation and calibration.  The general problem definition is now virtually complete in that bidding involves sequential and simultaneous decisions to be made over time, under conditions of uncertainty, and with multiple, conflicting objectives.  Problem formulation has been rather haphazard and many ad hoc models have been used, often with very little empirical support.  A major reason for this appears to be the lack of any real rival to Friedmanâ€™s implicit theoretical base.  This paper examines the approaches and models used in research with a view to the ultimate development of some theory on the subject.    Firstly, the relationship between bidding and estimating is considered along with the role of cost, price and other estimates.  Secondly, the criticisms of Friedmanâ€™s model are examined and in particular the efficacy of statistical models representing the various parts of the problem.  Finally, research n estimating accuracy is considered in terms of influencing factors and research methodology.  Key words: Bidding, estimating, statistical models.
