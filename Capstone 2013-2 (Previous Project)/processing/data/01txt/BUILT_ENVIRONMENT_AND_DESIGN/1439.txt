This paper discusses methods and techniques to be used for an ergonomic evaluation of products, product interfaces and systems. In this context evaluation is seen as a part of the design process that interacts with all design stages. It plays an integral role in it and is concerned with assuring a high degree of likelihood of the userâ€™s acceptance. Traditional and new evaluation methods such as task analysis, checklists, TA (talk/think aloud) protocols, CAD simulation are addressed.
