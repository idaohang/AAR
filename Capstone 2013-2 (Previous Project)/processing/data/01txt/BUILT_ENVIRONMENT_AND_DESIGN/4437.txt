An analysis is described of a sample of pre-bid forecasts for 181 Singapore building contracts awarded between 1980 and 1991 in comparison with previous results in the field.  Despite the apparent contradictions that occur between findings, it is shown that such differences could be illusionary due to a general lack of reported significance levels together with, in some cases, small sample sizes.  As a result it is suggested that a general commonality in outcomes may exist in the form of a single underlying variable.
