This paper examines the role of research within the architectural profession. It reports on the current development of a Research Policy by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and how this policy fits within a national exercise of research priority setting being undertaken by the Australian Federal Government. It discusses the professionâ€™s developing recognition of the necessity and value of research. The challenges of having the work of the architect understood and valued under the terms set by research funding and assessment bodies are discussed. While the paper deals specifically with the architectural profession, it highlights some of the difficulties faced by the humanities in relation to the development and recognition of research activity.
