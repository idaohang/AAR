The quality of site supervision has a major influence on the overall performance and efficiency of construction projects. Inadequate supervision is believed to be one of the major causes of rework. Therefore, experienced and well-trained supervisors have an important role in minimising the amount of rework due to construction defects.    This paper argues that the quality of site supervision Indonesia is directly related to the supervisorâ€™s level of experience gained through formal training. Hence, the paper attempts to explore the relationship between the quality of site supervision, expressed as training cost, and the rework cost borne by contractors in high-rise building construction.    Based on site data collection targeting ten building construction sites in Indonesia, this paper suggests that inadequate site supervision is the principal cause of rework during construction. It also offers insights into the statistical relationship between the cost of supervisorsâ€™ training and the cost of rework.    This research was carried out in the developing economy of Indonesia. It may be that the issues of site supervision evidence here are typical of other economies in transition.
