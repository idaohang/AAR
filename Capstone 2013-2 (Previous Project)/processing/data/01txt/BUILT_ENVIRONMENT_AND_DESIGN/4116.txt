Delay analysis and schedule compression are normally treated as separate, independent, aspects of the study of delays and their effects on the completion of construction projects. This paper examines the feasibility of integrating the delay analysis and schedule compression functions into a broad-scoped two-stage process. The main issue is shown to be the kind of delay analysis required for each stage of the process and seven existing techniques are illustrated for use in conjunction with schedule compression. Some necessary modifications to these techniques are identified together with a typology for categorising each technique.
