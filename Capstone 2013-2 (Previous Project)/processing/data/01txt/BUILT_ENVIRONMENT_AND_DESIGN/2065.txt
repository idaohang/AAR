This paper addresses the application of intuitive interaction to interface design. Intuition is based on experiential knowledge and people can only use intuitive processing if they have previous experience to draw on. Previous research has revealed that prior knowledge of features of a digital camera and a universal remote control allowed participants to use those features intuitively. An experiment was conducted to test various interfaces applied to the universal remote control. The interfaces were designed according to principles developed previously. Users were video recorded doing set tasks with one of the four remote control interfaces. The video data were later analysed using Noldus Observer VideoPro software. All of the new interfaces were found to be quicker and more intuitive to use than the default interface provided by the manufacturers. By applying the principles of intuitive interaction developed previously, it was possible to increase the intuitive usability of the product.
