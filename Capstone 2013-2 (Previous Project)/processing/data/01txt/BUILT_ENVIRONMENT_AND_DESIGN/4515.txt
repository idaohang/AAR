Many studies have shown that the careful planning of construction logistics can result in significant saving.  However, despite attempts to improve the logistics of construction materials, the purchase, delivery, storage and movement of materials are still conducted in a rather unstructured manner.  In this paper, construction logistics are modeled and analyzed using Petri Net (PN) techniques.  The background of the PN concept and its properties are first introduced, followed by an outline the PN model for construction logistics.  The likely effects before and after the introduction of the Just-In-Time (JIT) concept are then examined.  The findings suggest that significant time and cost savings can be made by incorporating the JIT concept.
