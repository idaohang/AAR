A prototype decision support/expert system for contractor prequalification, CP-DSS, is described.  The system firstly evaluates contractors' capabilities according to project specific criteria.  It then identifies any risks that may be caused by contractors.  Finally, contractors are appraised according to their likely performance, management capability, reputation, resources, progress, competitiveness and activeness and ranked in order of selection priority.
