Psychological sense of community (PSOC) is an intriguing construct that allows social scientists and psychologists to examine fundamental questions about how individuals are connected and committed to and influenced by the local residents who reside in a particular locality. In this study, initially exploration of sense of community within the chosen locality and population revealed that a â€˜sense of communityâ€™ (SOC) not only included social bonding aspects but was also related to the bonds people developed with the natural environment. The data reveals that feelings of attachment to the natural landscape proved equally, if not more important than social bonds between residents in the development of a SOC. An extensive body of literature exists that has explored the nature and complexities of peopleâ€™s emotional experience and relationships to place. The most common concepts are sense of place, place attachment, place identity and place dependence. While these concepts are broadly defined and discussed in theory, much research has concentrated on the notion of the home, limiting our understanding of this multi-faceted phenomenon. This paper intends to demonstrate the need to incorporate the full scale of human place related experiences that enable people to develop feelings of place attachment (PA) and incorporate these feelings into a cognitive structure representing their PSOC.  2
