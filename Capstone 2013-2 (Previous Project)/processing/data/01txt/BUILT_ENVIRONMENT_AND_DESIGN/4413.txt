This study investigates the service quality in the maintenance of mechanical and engineering services.  The determinants of service quality are identified and their means of evaluation are examined.  A method of assessment is devised based on the SERVQUAL approach and its use is then illustrated by means of a small empirical survey of clients and service providers and the Gap model used to quantify the relationships between customer satisfaction, expected service, perceived service and service quality gap.
