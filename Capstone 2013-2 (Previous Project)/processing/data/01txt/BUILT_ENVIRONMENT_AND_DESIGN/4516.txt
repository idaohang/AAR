This paper seeks to identify and classify the skill characteristics that underpin the collection, transfer and utilisation of building design information.  In so doing it is hoped that this paper will contribute to the debate on relevant core skills needed by construction professionals.     A model is proposed comprising thirty seven potential characteristics associated with a person undertaking the quantification task.  These characteristics are then subdivided into three groups -  technical soundness, educational soundness and personal soundness.    An empirical study is described in which twenty one representative characteristics of the above model were rated for importance by two groups of undergraduate quantity surveying students and a group of thirty practising quantity surveyors.  The resulting analysis found, in order of importance, educational soundness, technical soundness, and personal soundness to be the most important perceived groups of characteristics.
