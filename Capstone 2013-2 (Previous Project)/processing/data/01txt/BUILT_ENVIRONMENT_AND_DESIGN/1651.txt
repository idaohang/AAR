Combining passive elements with mechanical systems in office buildings may achieve a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, and an increase in occupant satisfaction. This parametric study explores the potential for reducing cooling loads through architectural design and mixed-mode systems for medium and high-rise office buildings in Brisbane. An example of basic plan type and building materials is used as the base case of the runs. Factors like window size and orientation, glazing types, shading, and ventilated facade form the control variables. A-TAS module of TAS Building Design software is the tool of the study.
