This paper describes a postal survey of UK Quantity Surveyors to relate human factors, such as experience and personality, to early stage estimating expertise.  Composite variables were derived by factor analysis and examined against estimates of average national prices for several types of building.    The results indicate a coefficient of variation of 20.5% (17% mean modulus) for the estimates of the 82 respondents.  The analysis suggests that expertise does not generalise across generic contract types.  It was found that subjects with greater current experience in estimating prices of commercial buildings, who thought training, attribution, length of service, efficiency and discernment to be important, and who are particularly client oriented, tended to overestimate.  Subjects with greater current experience in estimating prices of industrial buildings, and who thought cost limits and self-discipline to be important, tended to underestimate.
