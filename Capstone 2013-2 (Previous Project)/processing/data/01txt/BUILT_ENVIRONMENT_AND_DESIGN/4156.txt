Delay in the completion of a construction project can be a major problem for contractor companies leading to costly disputes and adverse relationships amongst project participants. Projects can be delayed for a large number of reasons. The reasons are related to the various types of uncertainty associated with activities during the construction process. This research was conducted to determine the most important causes of delays within building projects in Indonesia. A questionnaire survey was carried out targeting 89 respondents from large contractors and 23 respondents from small contractors. The respondents were asked to assess the level of effect the 31 potential delay causes on their projects. The delay factors were grouped into six major groups. The level of importance of the delay variables and the groups were computed and ranked for both the large and small contractors. Personal interviews were conducted to clarify responses. The agreement between the rankings of delay causes of two groups contractors were measured using Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficients. The results showed that the large and small contractors generally agree on the importance ranking of the individual delay variables. In relation to the groups of the delay variable, however, the result showed that there is no agreement between the two groups of contractors. The professional management group was ranked the highest and the external groups was ranked the lowest by large contractors. Whereas, small contractors ranked the design and documentation group as the highest and the execution group as the lowest.
