This paper provides the results of an exploratory survey of construction industry managers in Singapore to isolate some of the common effects of national and organisational culture, together with the personal characteristics of managers, on the efficacy of project communication.  By examination of significant correlation coefficients, the various types of influences are identified.  The results of the research suggest that the managersâ€™ attitude and behaviours toward communication may be guided to large extent by their level of competence.  The study also provides evidence to suggest that the individualsâ€™ understanding of the communication process and its barriers, the way they behave with other individuals and expect to be treated, varies according to national cultures.
