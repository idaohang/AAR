This paper describes a structured methodology for modelling the information requirements of contracting firms' tender adjudication decisions.  The method adopted is based on the techniques of information strategy planning and critical success factor analysis used in the development of executive information systems (EISs).  A general background explication is followed by a discussion relating to the development of a prototype computer based system ESSTA (Executive Support System for Tender Adjudication), based on an empirical analysis of two UK contracting firms and utilising the above techniques.  The result is a system that focuses on supporting, rather than replacing, the judgements and perceptions of adjudication decision makers.
