Two case studies of project partnering in Australia are described.  Case Study 1 is of the Woodford Prison, a design and construct project that won the Australian Master Builders 1996 National Partnering Award.  Case Study 2 is of the Southport Courthouse, a project procured by conventional lump-sum competitive tender which was demonstrating signs of claimsmanship, time and cost overruns and threats of disputation.  Both projects involved the same contractor and government department client.  The results indicate that quite different outcomes can occur when using different project procurement methods, even though the same personnel are involved using the same partnering processes and procedures.  A second inference that may be drawn is that the general conditions of contract may need to be in concert with the aims and objectives of partnering.
