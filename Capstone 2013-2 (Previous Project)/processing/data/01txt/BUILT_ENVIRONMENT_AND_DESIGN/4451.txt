This study aims to find a correlation between winter and outdoor design temperature (WDT) and mass of the building envelope. The daily variations of the inside temperatures and heat fluxes of the walls under various climatic conditions and differant wall constructions have been calculated by a computer program based on the response factor technique, which uses variable outside air temperature and solar radiation and constant inside air temperature values as input climate data. The analysis of the relation between mass of the walls and inside surface heat fluxes resulted with the correction values for winter design temperature (WDTCV) depending on the mass of the wall and on the direction of facades for differant climatic zones.
