The dominant life cycle model of building materials and components is a linear system, which ends in demolition and disposal.  If however, the act of demolition is replaced with the act of disassembly, more materials and components can be reused and recycled.  This suggests a different life cycle model, one that accommodates an increase in service life.  To achieve extended service life designers must design buildings for disassembly to facilitate the new steps in the life cycle and encourage the reuse and recycling of materials and components.  Experience gained in the industrial design field and knowledge from attempts at creating disassemblable buildings can be used to create a set of guidelines for design for disassembly.  Such a set of guidelines could be implemented to extend service life and improve environmental sustainability.
