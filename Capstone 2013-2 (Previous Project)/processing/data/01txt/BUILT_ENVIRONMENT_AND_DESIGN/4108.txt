The paper examines the role and nature of trust in construction project management performance.  Three causes, or antecedents, of trust are identified - results, integrity and concern.  A questionnaire survey of construction project team members employed by three public sector infrastructure organisations in Singapore is described.  The results confirm the expected correlations.  Concluding remarks suggest that enlightened management is needed to keep the three antecedents in reasonable balance.
