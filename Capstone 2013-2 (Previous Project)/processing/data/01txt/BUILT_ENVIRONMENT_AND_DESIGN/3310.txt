Academic staff from four disciplines formed an interdisciplinary team to develop a curriculum for collaborative learning across three schools.  The curriculum focused on the ability of students to translate the principles of sustainability into practical design solutions for the Gardens Point campus of QUT.  The teaching and learning opportunities associated with the project encouraged students to investigate the sustainability issues within a precinct of the campus, produce a concept plan to improve the site and study a particular issue in further detail to inform detailed proposals for QUT.  Most students said they had a positive experience in working with colleagues and staff from other disciplines and further joint projects should be developed to involve students from allied disciplines.  This paper describes how the curriculum for collaborative learning in sustainability was designed and the lessons learned from its implementation.
