This paper examines the role of scope and certainty in research outcomes.  The relationship between scope and certainty is considered and the characteristics of 'good' research and the proposition is made that scope and certainty information alone is sufficient to legitimise research outcomes.  This comes with the realisation that the research process is primarily concerned with maximising scope and certainty per se independent of issues, such as novelty, intelligibility and rigour, that affect publication prospects.  The aim is to discover the extent to which research outcomes can legitimately exist independently of publication criteria and the necessary and sufficient criteria involved.
