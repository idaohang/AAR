This paper reports the results of two recent studies concerning the attitudes of women toward the UK construction industry.  The major finding from both studies is that females perceive the UK construction industry to have a low level image comparable with a cottage industry, and a recommendation is made for increased publicity and education about the construction industry and its professional occupations.
