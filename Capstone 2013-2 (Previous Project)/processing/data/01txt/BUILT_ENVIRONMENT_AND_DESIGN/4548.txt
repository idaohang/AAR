The performance of construction site tradespeople is one of critical factors to the success of any construction project. Poor quality of construction site tradespeople in the Indonesian construction industry contributes a major influence on the overall performance and efficiency of construction projects. In fact, contractors are still facing lack of site tradespeopleâ€™s skill to complete construction projects satisfactorily. Most &quot;skilled&quot; tradespeople enter construction industry and receive informal training from a master craftsman, rather than following a formal course conducted by an institution. This paper argues that well-trained site tradespeople have an important role in minimising the amount of construction waste activities during the construction process leading to reduce companyâ€™s productivity. The paper introduces a just-in-time (JIT) training program for construction site tradespeople, in which they are trained while they are doing a construction activity by receiving one-on-one instruction from a supervisor. Hence, the paper attempts to explore a significant role of JIT training program during the construction process and its relationship with construction site tradespeopleâ€™s productivity. Based on three case studies targeted at building construction in Indonesia, this paper states that a significant achievement in increasing companyâ€™s productivity has been attained by contracting companies that have conducted JIT training for their site tradespeople. Evidence of the increase of the companyâ€™s productivity is expressed by measuring the value of the PPC of the projects.
