This paper would discuss how designers contribute towards the culture of waste, which results in environmental degradation. Various reasons on why designers sometimes produce such waste would be explored. Contrary, designers can offer us our greatest environmental hope if they are conscious about the impact of their products on the environment. Proposals would be advanced on how this culture of waste could be tackled. This includes designers adopting methodologies such as user-centred design, eco-design and dematerialisation. These methodologies were used by the forth year Design and Technology students of the University of Botswana.
