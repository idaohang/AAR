33 stressors covering various aspects of project implementation, such as organisation policies, working relationships, communication and personal factors, are identified and the manageability of the common stressors faced by management of construction projects in Hong Kong is assessed by means of a questionnaire survey.  It is shown that the most difficult stressors to manage are &quot;bureaucracy&quot;, &quot;lack of opportunity to learn new skills&quot;, &quot;work-family conflicts&quot; and &quot;different view from superiors&quot;.  The results also revealed that the patterns of stress manageability differ between clients, consultants and contractors.  The relationships among individual stressors are similarly examined.  The extent to which stress effects combine and accumulate when related stressors coexist is also considered.
