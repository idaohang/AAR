This paper presents a discussion about the common mode of architectural practice that sees the knowledge of architects spread wide but thin across many areas. It proposes, by example, a different mode of practice that sees the architect limiting the scope or breadth of practice, but deepening the knowledge of, and influence upon, a project. When the architect is also the builder, an internalised form of collaboration and a range of new possibilities occurs. There is the potential for on-site detailing which can lead to a different mode of practice and a different tectonically influenced style of architecture. The role of contract documents changes. Knowledge from two fields is blended and a more sophisticated knowledge base, by virtue of it broader field of input, is made possible.
