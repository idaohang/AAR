One of the major hindrances to successful deconstruction, for the reuse of building materials and components, is the difficulty in recovering items in good condition. Modern construction methods are very dependent on permanent fixing methods that allow for little else but destructive demolition. If buildings were initially designed for deconstruction, it would be possible to successfully recover much more material for reuse. This would have significant advantages both economically and environmentally.    In an attempt to establish a knowledge base for understanding design for deconstruction, this paper poses a number of questions. These questions can in part be answered by a number of related theories and research fields. The relationships between these theories and design for deconstruction are investigated and developed. There are four main parts to these investigations:    â€¢	an understanding of how design for deconstruction fits into the broader issues of sustainable construction  â€¢	the theory of time related building layers  â€¢	the theory of a hierarchy of recycling and reuse  â€¢	a list of design for deconstruction principles
