This paper examines the relationship between the competitiveness of contract bids entered by individual bidders through the variables of bidder size, contract value and project type.   The analysis indicates that, in terms of competitiveness, there is a relationship between the size of bidder and size of contract.  This concurs with previous work in the field.  Bidders having competitiveness affinities towards particular types of projects, although apparent, appear to be weaker for the private sector than found in previous work concerning the public sector.
