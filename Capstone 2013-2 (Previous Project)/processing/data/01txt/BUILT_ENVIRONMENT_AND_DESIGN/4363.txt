This study aims to find optimum values for sizing the windows and Trombe walls and to develop rules of thumb for the climatic conditions of Ankara, which has cold and long winters and hot summers. On a test building having a floor area of 100 mÂ² and a test room with a floor area changing from 10 to 50 mÂ², the effect of the size of windows and Trombe walls on heating, cooling, and total energy needs of the room have been analysed by the help of the computer program named &quot;SUNCODE&quot;. Computer simulations are carried out and optimum values for energy demand are obtained and tables are prepared.
