This research was aimed at examining the role of ethics in tendering.  To do this is was first necessary to define what is meant by ethics and in the context of tendering and how this relates to the various codes of tendering practice.  The next step was to conduct a questionnaire survey to ascertain the extent to which ethical behaviour in tendering is supported and practised in Australia.  This showed that most companies support the use codes of tendering, defend the right of withdrawal of tenders, disapprove of bid shopping, cover pricing and union involvement in the tendering process, support the principals' right to know what is included in a tender and the self-regulation of the tendering codes.  In addition, most companies have developed, and follow, idiosyncratic ethical guidelines that are independent of, and often contrary to, the nationally prescribed codes.  The major conclusion is that a more empirical approach to the development of future ethical prescriptions in the field is needed.
