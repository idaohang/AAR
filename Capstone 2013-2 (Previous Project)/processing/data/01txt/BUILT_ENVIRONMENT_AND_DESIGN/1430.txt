This research was undertaken to provide the designers of interactive artifacts with more knowledge about the human users of these artifacts, and a better understanding of how they use them. Therefore the research explored differences and similarities between novice and expert users of interactive artifacts. In order to achieve this, protocol analysis was used to identify usersâ€™ cognitive categories, knowledge categories and knowledge representation. Based on the taxonomy proposed and differences identified, each cognitive category was modelled. The models are designed on the premises that knowledge â€” domain-specific knowledge in particular â€” plays a significant role in distinguishing a novice from an expert user, and the way in which they use technologically interactive devices. They also constitute the features that reflect the kind of processes, representations, strategies or knowledge organisation that may occur for each cognitive category during the interaction. The models contribute to the better understanding of the differences between the novice and expert users while they interact with artifacts. Their potential applications are: (a) as designersâ€™ computer support tool to understand better the users of the artifact they design; (b) in design research in order to get better understanding how designers work; (c) for artifact useability assessment; (d) in education and design education in particular and (d) for different training procedures. This paper will explore the model applications to the design process. It will attempt to clarify how) the usersâ€™ model should be included in the design process.
