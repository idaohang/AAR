The selection of a competent architect is vital to the success of a development.  Like many developed countries in the world, developers in Hong Kong select architect based on a set of criteria.  Although price is not the only consideration in the process, decisions rely heavily on subjective judgement.  By conducting a questionnaire survey, this research identified the common criteria for selection and their relative importance to an objective selection.  This involved the use of an evaluation method called the analytical hierarchy process (AHP).  Survey data from projects with similar characteristics was used to compute the criteria weights.  Multi-criteria models for 7 out of 27 categories of project were built with reference to the computed weights derived from survey.  In addition, a computer programme named as &quot;Architectural Consultant Selection System&quot; (ACSS) was designed to illustrate a logical approach for the evaluation of prospective consultant architects based on the constructed models.
