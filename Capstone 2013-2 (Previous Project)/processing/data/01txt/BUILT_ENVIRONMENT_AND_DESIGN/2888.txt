The disassembly of buildings to recover materials and components for future reuse is not widely practiced in the modern construction industry. This note covers a range of themes and offers a set of principles, or guidelines, for design for disassembly that can be applied to a project in order to facilitate and encourage greater rates of reuse and recycling in the future. The note builds upon the previous note DES31 â€˜Design for Disassemblyâ€™ by offering more specific guidance on why, when, what and how to design for disassembly. Further to that, it describes a more developed relationship between significant issues surrounding design for disassembly.
