This paper describes two recent independent studies of inter-cultural project communication â€“ one in Singapore and one in Samoa.  Although neither researcher was aware of the otherâ€™s work, both conducted a literature review of related topics and carried out questionnaire sur-veys on the impact of national culture and organizational culture on project communications.    Both studies concluded that the managersâ€™ attitude and behaviours toward communication are guided to large extent by their level of competence, suggesting that the individualsâ€™ un-derstanding of the communication process and its barriers, the way they behave with other individuals and expect to be treated, varies according to national cultures.  Of particular note were the managersâ€™ realizations about cultural influences on their own behaviours including value conflicts with others, and the importance of developing at least a tolerance for cultural differences.  A further feature was the link between personal transition and cultural adjust-ment.  Managers, who were able to set aside personal discomforts and take on new ways of learning and relating to others, reported an impact on their value shifts and appreciation for the strengths of the host culture.
