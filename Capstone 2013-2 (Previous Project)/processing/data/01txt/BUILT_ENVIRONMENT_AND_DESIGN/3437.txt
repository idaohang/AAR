The findings are presented of a competency survey of project managers in South East Queensland, Australia.  This was designed to capture the â€˜real worldâ€™ experiences and skills of current practicing project managers, and investigate the most important project management skills that a project manager must possess, and obtain any additional skills and/or issues that a project manager should possess and be aware of in the twenty-first century.    In terms of project management skills, it was found that the ability to communicate, ability to meet project objectives and make decisions are the most important skills needed.  In contrast, ability to use computer/project management software and ability to manage legal issues are the least important skills.  In terms of current skills, the older managers, with the exception of the use of computer/project management software, have a greater degree of project management skills than their younger counterparts.  The biggest gap between skills needed and skills possessed is in communication.    The issues and skills that a project manager should be aware of and possess in the foreseeable future were found to comprise industrial relations, workplace health and safety, environmental issues, adaptability/innovative/flexibility, stakeholders management skill, coaching/transfer of knowledge skill, client related skill, networking skill and business skill.
