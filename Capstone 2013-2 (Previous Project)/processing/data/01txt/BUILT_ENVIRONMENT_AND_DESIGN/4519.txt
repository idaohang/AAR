Recently completed research from an international study has created a framework of six factors shown to be relevant and important in developing the construction industry.  The framework was developed by a two-stage research methodology using firstly interview data and secondly quantitative data in a wider survey.  This paper applies this framework to a particular construction industry, namely, that in Hong Kong. Through using the theory, the paper is intended to confirm those factors which have been already captured by existing studies, including two major reports, but also to highlight any key factors that may have been overlooked. The findings are that the six-factor model is both robust and comprehensive. This is important now, since the Hong Kong Government is currently putting into action a series of measures for further development of the construction industry.
