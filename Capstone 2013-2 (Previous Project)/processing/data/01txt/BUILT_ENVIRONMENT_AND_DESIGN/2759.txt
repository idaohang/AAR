Residential developments built with houses that use passive design features can have significantly reduced energy requirements for thermal comfort. In the context of global warming, this can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The current trend toward higher lot density in residential developments and the resulting increase in thermal mass increases the associated heat island effect. Designers of future residential developments face the dual challenges of heat island impacts and any future global warming. Resource efficient house designs combined with approaches that mitigate the outdoor heat load must be considered and addressed from the design of the initial subdivision layout. Some land sub-division and house design initiatives are proposed for sub-tropical south east Queensland, Australia. Computer simulations that account for heat island and global warming effects are used to estimate the indoor thermal performance of display houses for current climate conditions and scenarios that may occur in the future. A north-south orientation of narrow building lots combined with high albedo house surfaces and the increased use of shade trees can significantly reduce the heat island effect of high density residential developments. The cooling requirements of houses with high energy rating (5 star) are increasingly superior to those with low rating (3.5 star) in scenarios of global warming.
