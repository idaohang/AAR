A postal questionnaire survey is described involving a sample of 41 clients, 34 contractors and 35 consultants and concerning their experiences and attitudes to a variety of project delivery systems and the criteria used for selection.  The results indicate that a simple set of the criteria are generally adequate and sufficient for procurement path selection and that there is a reasonable consensus on their appropriate weighting for each path.  It is also shown that similar clients generally do not have similar project delivery needs but nevertheless only one delivery method, that of novation, best satisfies the needs of those involved in the study.
