A multivariate approach to contract bidding strategies in the construction industry is presented.  This represents a radical departure from previous work in the field by using all available data on competing bidders.  'Optimal', 'no loss' and 'break even' mark up strategies are derived and methods of parameter estimation proposed.  A case study shows how the three strategic mark up values are calculated against known competitors.
