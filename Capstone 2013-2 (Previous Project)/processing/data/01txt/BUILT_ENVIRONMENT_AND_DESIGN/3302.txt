An understanding of the complex problems of land use competition requires an appreciation of natural processes, cultural values, economic imperatives and political agendas.  This integrated understanding is an important component of the study program for tertiary students about to complete their professional qualification in landscape architecture at the Queensland University of Technology.  This paper introduces a repertoire of game templates as an initial step in formulating a conceptual framework for the curriculum/games designer to explore the potential of play in ecological landscape planning.  The concepts of social action space, permissible action space and motivational action space are used to investigate the qualities of each template for further game design development.  The abstraction of these concepts may assist the designer to move beyond the usability of games into viewing their value as a learning method.
