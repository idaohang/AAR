This paper explores the relationship between culture and human-centred design in Botswana, a topic on which there is little previous research. The paper develops a framework of cultural analysis, comparing traditional with contemporary variables in order to develop a set of core variables that can be applicable to product design. Content analysis methodology was used to extract traditional variables from Botswana folktales, and qualitative data analysis methods were used to analyse contemporary variables. The results indicated that there is more emphasis on non-material than material variables.  The paper concludes with a discussion of how to develop cultural strategies that will improve the potential of using human-centred design approach as the key to designing culturally sensitive products.
