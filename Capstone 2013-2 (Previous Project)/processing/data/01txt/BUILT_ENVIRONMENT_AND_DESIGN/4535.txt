The situation is considered where a target contract has commenced, some interim valuations of progress have been made, and estimates of future interim valuations are needed.  Three approaches are examined - (1) analytic, (2) synthetic, and (3) hybrid.  Using six 2 parameter models - (1) DHSS, (2) Kenley-Wilson, (3) Berny-Howes, (4) cumulative logistic, (5) cumulative normal, and (6) cumulative lognormal - it is shown that, with the data used, that the best hybrid models produced the most accurate ex-ante expenditure flow forecasts from 10 to 90 percent contract duration and all the hybrid models produced the most accurate ex-ante expenditure flow forecasts from 10 to 50 percent contract duration.
