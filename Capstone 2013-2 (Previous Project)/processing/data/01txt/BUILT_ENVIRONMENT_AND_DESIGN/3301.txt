Prediction of probable final construction cost is the predominant task of cost estimators.  While majority of construction projects are procured under a fixed price nature, any errors in cost prediction could undermine the project success and ultimately reduce the profit margin.  Cost estimation not only relies on a precise analysis of available data but also involves the use of subjective judgement especially in the absence of perfect data.  Producing accurate cost estimation within an unrealistically short tendering period has exerted a great deal of stress on estimators.  In fact, it is well known that cost estimation is a very stressful business.  This paper identifies the main causes of the stress endured by cost estimators by a survey of construction cost estimators in Hong Kong.  Using correlation analysis, regression analysis and structural equation modelling, the relationships amongst the stressors (stress factors) and stress are examined and a causal structural model is developed.  The results indicate work overload, role conflict, job ambiguity, and working environment to be the critical stressors involved, with work underload and distrust being the stressors being indirectly influencing factors.
