It has been said that the effective performance of the Project Manager (PM) is the single most critical factor affecting successful project outcomes.  Little is known, however, of the nature and extent of the hindrances to PM effectiveness in the Construction Industry (CI).  This paper reports on the results of a worldwide survey of PMs concerning these issues and shows that they have the potential to be 17 to 22% more effective and 16 to 17% more productive in their working.  Associated with this is a need for 20% more aware of progress and developments in the CI generally, 27% more aware of progress and developments in their own organization, 18% more delegation of contract administration tasks, 25% more general administrative support.  Also highlighted is the lengthy working hours of PMs â€“ estimated at around 58 hours per week.
