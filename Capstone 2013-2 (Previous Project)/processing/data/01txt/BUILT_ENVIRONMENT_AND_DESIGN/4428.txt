The contractor prequalification process is characterised by the lack of an universally accepted system and appropriate quantitative and qualitative information. This has led to the development of a number of proprietary prequalification systems together with an over-reliance on human judgement for assessment in practice. To improve the reliability and objectiveness of decisions being made, prequalification needs to be carried out on a more rational basis. An emerging technology in artificial intelligence, namely case based reasoning (CBR), appears to have high potential to satisfy the specific characteristics of the prequalification domain. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate, through the development of a prototype system, the practicality and suitability of CBR approach for prequalification.
