Research is carried out in the form of a survey, which attempts to explore and demonstrate the approach of architects to climate responsive building design practice in South-East Queensland. The hypothesis for the survey is to identify if architects take climate responsive design (CRD) principles into consideration during the design stage of a project. Results indicate that architects understand the importance of designing in response to the environment; they value CRD as important and believe that CRD strongly contributes to good design; there will be a need for specialised consultants for large-scaled projects to aid in dealing with sustainable ideas. However, there is a decline in the commitment from beginning to the end of the project and they believe that the main hindrances are the client (budgetary constraints, lack of understanding) and Town Planning rather than their own lack of understanding. They also think that clients must be educated in how to maintain climate responsive processes of the building.
