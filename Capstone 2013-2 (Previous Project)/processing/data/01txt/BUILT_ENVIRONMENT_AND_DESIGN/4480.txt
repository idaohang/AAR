Research is described aimed at developing a benchmarking system for University Schools of Construction Management.  This follows a standard empirical approach in soliciting views and requirements from a group of stakeholders comprising the Australasian Universities Building Education Association Heads of Schools.  These views were analysed and consolidated into a set of 34 benchmarks and associated likely data sources.  Following a pilot study investigating the data collection logistics involved, these were reduced down to a set of 20 tables capable of being produced by each participant over a reasonably short period.  As a result, the stage has now been reached where the tables have been completed by several of the participants for consolidation into a benchmark publication.
