In the United Kingdom (UK), most clients adopt a selective approach to tendering that involves the prequalification of bidders through an assessment of their likelihood of producing good quality work, on time and within budget. Despite its strategic significance, there is a lack of a universally agreed standard upon which prequalification should be carried out. Clients assess contractors' capabilities on a subjective and informal basis. In this paper, the processes involved in contractor prequalification and the assessment methods used at different stages of prequalification are examined through a survey of clients and consultants in the UK with a view to identifying a possible rational and practical computer-based approach. The results suggest that this may be achieved through the development of a hybrid rule-based / multiattribute model. The decision rules and structure of the multiattribute model are presented in this paper.
