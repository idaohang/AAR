This paper investigates how culture can be integrated into designing products within Botswanaâ€™s context. The concept of culture and design compliment each other and one is inconceivable without the other. Therefore, design does not take place in isolation but it is embedded in usersâ€™ culture. Designers need to be mindful of the interdependence between culture and design because it might enable them to improve their concepts in responding appropriately to usersâ€™ needs, wants and desires. However, it has been observed that there is little in-depth research on this topic.    In order to explore the relationship between culture and design, an experimental approach was adopted. The experiment was conducted with design students of the University of Botswana. This experiment involved analysing and identifying socio-cultural factors from Botswanaâ€™s folktales and other sources that impact upon design. The challenge for participants was to transfer and apply the identified socio-cultural factors into product design features which have relevance to the local context. The socio-cultural factors were broadly divided into two broad groups that is, traditional and contemporary. The data comprised of visual and textual data. This data was then analysed using the qualitative content analysis methodology.     The paper concludes by discussing a proposed socio-cultural design model developed from the results which might assist designers to integrate culture by â€˜conscious design effortâ€™ rather than by â€˜accident or incidentlyâ€™ in product design. This is ultimately expected to lead to more innovative, culturally sensitive and user-friendly products.
