Several studies report that private renters are far more likely to cite lack of  security of tenure as a disadvantage than those who rent from the public  sector (Foard, et al, 1994; Burgess &amp; Skeltys, 1992). Understanding the role  of tenure security in the private rental sector is important given that private  rental, in general, has become a &quot;more permanent element of the housing  careers of low-, and increasingly middle-, income Australians&quot; (Beer, 1999).  The challenge for both policy makers and housing providers is to understand  the nature of demand for legal security of tenure across different categories of  low and moderate-income renters. This paper provides a framework for  exploring the effects of a number of demographic, dispositional and  circumstantial variables on the demand for security of tenure including tradeoffs  that are relevant to these preferences. The paper then discusses some  results of preliminary focus groups that shed light on the contexts in which  preferences for length of lease and so on are discussed. It is argued that  these should form the basis of a further study that addresses tenantsâ€™  expectations and practices with respect to security of tenure, and the way  these can inform strategies aimed at successful housing (DoH) and building  the capacity (FACS) of private renters to achieve this.
