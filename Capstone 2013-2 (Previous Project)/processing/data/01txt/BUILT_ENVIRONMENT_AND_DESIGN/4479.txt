This paper presents the results of an empirical investigation into the attitudes of final year construction management students to moral issues in tendering.  A survey elicited the studentsâ€™ attitudes towards participating in various forms of collusive tendering and cartel arrangements.  Their responses are summarised and presented alongside the decision making factors that influence their choices.  The results indicate a tendency towards, or, at best, a high tolerance of morally deviant behaviour. The  paper concludes that the studentsâ€™ understanding of, and respect for, the law, the professional codes of practice  and their aims appear to be insufficient.
