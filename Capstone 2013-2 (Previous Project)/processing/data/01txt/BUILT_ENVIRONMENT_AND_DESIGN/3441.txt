This paper examines the extent to which challenges in the workplace may cause women project managers to be in a significantly small minority.  A survey of members of the Australian Institute of Project Management in Queensland is described.  This compares the experiences and observations of both males and females on various issues related to technical and gender aspects in the project management workplace.  The results show that, while female project managers experience many problems, male project managers also experience most of the same problems.  Likewise, there are also few differences between the more experienced and less experienced, level of management and types of industries.  The differences that do occur include discrimination against women in general, differences in project management styles and the support from other project managers.
