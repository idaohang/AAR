This study is based on thermal performance analysis and evaluation of the National Observatory guesthouse with the software SUNCODE-PC. The study is unique owing to its high-altitude site (2465 m) in a remote area, harsh climate (with almost no data available), and functional restrictions of astronomical facilities. The design is thermally evaluated through differant modes of application of insulation, materials, types of glazing, window/wall-ratios, Trombe walls, winter night insulation, summer ventilation and shading.
