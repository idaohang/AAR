The joint probability between two binary strings of differenet lengths has been demonstrated as a suitable basis for a correlation attack on the shrinking generator when the decimation probability is 0.5. As an extension of this, further computer simulations have been conducted to determine whether the joint probability can be used as a basis for similar correlation attacks on irregularly clocked shift registers, where the deletions occur independently with a fixed probabilitydifferent from 0.5. These results show that as the decimation probability increases, the length of the known keystream required for the joint probability to be a useful measure of correlation must also be increased.  Thus the joint probability is shown to be a suitable basis for such correlation attacks, provided a sufficient length of the keystream is known.
