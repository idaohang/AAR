Complementing our recent work on subspace wavepacket propagation [Chem. Phys. Lett. 336 (2001) 149], we introduce a Lanczos-based implementation of the Faber polynomial quantum long-time propagator. The original version [J. Chem. Phys. 101 (1994) 10493] implicitly handles non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, that is, those perturbed by imaginary absorbing potentials to handle unwanted reflection effects. However, like many wavepacket propagation schemes, it encounters a bottleneck associated with dense matrixâ€“vector multiplications. Our implementation seeks to reduce the quantity of such costly operations without sacrificing numerical accuracy. For some benchmark scattering problems, our approach compares favourably with the original.
