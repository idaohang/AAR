Methods are introduced and illustrated for synthesising evidence from case control and cohort studies, and controlled trials, accounting for differences among the studies in their design, length of followup and quality. The methods, based on hierarchical but nonexchangeable Bayesian models, are illustrated in a synthesis of disparate information about the health effects of passive exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.
