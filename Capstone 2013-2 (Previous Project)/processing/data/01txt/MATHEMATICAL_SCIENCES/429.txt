We introduce continuous-time random processes whose spectral density is unbounded at some non-zero frequencies.  The discretized versions of these processes have asymptotic properties similar to those of discrete-time Gegenbauer processes.  We present some properties of the covariance function and spectral density as well as a theory of statistical estimation of the mean and covariance function of such processes.  Some direction for further generalizations of the results are indicated.
