This paper presents a renomalization and homogenization theory for fractional-in-space or in-time diffusion equations with singular random initial conditions.  The spectral representations for the solutions of these equations are provided.  Gaussian and non-Gaussian limiting ditributions of the renormalized solutions of these equations are then described in terms of multiple stochastic integral representatives.
