In this paper we assess appropriate statistical methodology for modelling a continuous response variable with data recorded through a longitudinal social survey.  The variables of interest in this study have been captured by the Longitudinal Suvery of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA) which is the most comprehensive suvery of immigrants ever to be undertaken in Australia.  The LSIA cohort had a sample siza of 5192 Principal Applicants (PA) and was completed in February 1999.  The survey consisted of three waves of interviews for each participating immigrant, at fixed time intervals following arrival in Australia.  The purpose of the model is to quantify the relationships between income levels of immigrants and various explanatory variables collected throughout the survey.  Of particular interest is the trend in the relationship between an immigrant's Visa Category and income level as the settlement process continues.  Results show that predicted mean income is highest for employed PAs and income for males is higher than income for females.  For employed PAs, the predicted mean income is highest for the Independent Visa Category but for non-participant and unemployed PAs, income is highest for those with a Humanitarian Visa Category.  It appears that once an immigrant enters the labour force, the level of income achieved is not associated with Visa Category.
