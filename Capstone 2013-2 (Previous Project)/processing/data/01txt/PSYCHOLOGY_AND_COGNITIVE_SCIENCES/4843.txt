This paper reports research findings of a critical ethnography concerning interactions between discourse, diversity and access to multiliteracies.  The research was conducted in a culturally and linguistically diverse year six classroom. The findings concern the degree to which culturally non-dominant students drew from their existing cultural resources and conditions on the use of home discourses. This is contrasted with the way in which culturally dominant students were familiar with classroom discourse and the implications of this for the distribution of access to multiliteracies. The article concludes with a call for teachers to use cultural differences as a resource for multiliteracies.
