This paper discusses preliminary findings from a review of Random Breath Testing (RBT) in Queensland. In particular, it examines RBT operational practices within the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and their alignment with best practice features of RBT identified in the literature. The study utilised a systems-based model, extrapolated from the organisational management literature, and involved semi-structured interviews with QPS staff involved in the planning and delivery of RBT operations. The interviews confirmed QPSâ€™s commitment to RBT and support for its underlying principles, evidenced in the high testing rates currently  achieved There are, however, some key issues of concern, including: quality vs. quantity of RBT tests; confusion about the role of RBT; and the need for further education about the roles of deterrence and apprehension. The findings of the study have a number of important implications for improving the management and operation of RBT.
