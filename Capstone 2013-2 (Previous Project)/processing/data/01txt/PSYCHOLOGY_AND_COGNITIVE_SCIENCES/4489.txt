The influence of choice on individualsâ€™ social identification and Psychological Sense of Community (PSOC) with their group memberships is a little examined area. The current study examined participantsâ€™ (N = 219) level of social identification and PSOC across multiple group memberships that differ in the degree of choice associated with membership. In addition, consideration was given to the influence of contextual salience on the relationship between choice and social identification and PSOC. Results indicated that, controlling for contextual salience, choice was positively associated with levels of social identification and PSOC.
