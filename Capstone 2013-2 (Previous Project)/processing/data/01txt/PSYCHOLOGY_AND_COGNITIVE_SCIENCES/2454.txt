Group task satisfaction is defined as the group's shared attitude toward its task and the associated work environment. It represents the group-level counterpart to individual job satisfaction. An investigation of group task satisfaction in 47 student groups demonstrated that group members were able to distinguish among group task satisfaction, task cohesion, social cohesion, group potency, group climate, and individual job satisfaction. Ratings of group task satisfaction displayed within-group agreement and significant between-group variance. Group task satisfaction was related to the mean level of individual job satisfaction within the group and the quality of the group's work.
