Through a prospective study of 70 youths staying at homeless-youth shelters, the authors tested the utility of I. Ajzenâ€™s (1991) theory of planned behavior (TPB), by comparing the constructs of self-efficacy with perceived behavioral control (PBC), in predicting peopleâ€™s rule-following behavior during shelter stays. We performed the first wave of data collection through a questionnaire assessing the standard TPB components of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intentions in relation to following the set rules at youth shelters. Further, we distinguished between items assessing perceived behavioral control (or perceived control) and those reflecting self-efficacy (or perceived difficulty). At the completion of each youthâ€™s stay at the shelter, shelter staff rated the rule adherence for that participant. Regression analyses revealed some support for the theory of planned behavior in that subjective norm was a significant predictor of intentions. However, self-efficacy emerged as the strongest predictor of intentions and was the only significant predictor of rule-following behavior. Thus, the results of the present study indicate the possibility that self-efficacy is integral to predicting rule adherence within this context and reaffirm the importance of incorporating notions of peopleâ€™s perceived ease or difficulty in performing actions in models of attitudeâ€“behavior prediction.
