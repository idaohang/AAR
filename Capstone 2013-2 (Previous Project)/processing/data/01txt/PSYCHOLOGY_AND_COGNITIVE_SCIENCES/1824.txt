The present paper reports on the development of a qualitative career assessment activity, specifically the My System of Career Influences (MSCI) Reflection Activity. The paper describes the process of development and the testing of the instrument. The testing was conducted in two stages with adults and adolescents. Findings from Stage 1 indicate that the MSCI (Pilot version) is a useful instrument that warrants separate versions for adults and adolescents. Findings from Stage 2 indicate that the MSCI (Adolescent version) is a useful instrument that is appropriate for use with adolescents. Suggestions for future refinement and testing of the MSCI are presented.
