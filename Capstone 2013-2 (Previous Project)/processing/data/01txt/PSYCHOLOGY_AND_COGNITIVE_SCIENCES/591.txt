The combination of alcohol and driving is a major health and economic burden to the community. Drink driving remains a serious threat to public safety that results in injuries, fatalities and property damage.  An array of rehabilitative and vehicle-based sanctions are currently being implemented around the world in an attempt to reduce the prevalence of convicted drink drivers continuing to re-offend after being sanctioned.  One type of vehicle-based sanction that is becoming increasingly used in a number of jurisdictions to reduce recidivist drink driving is the breath alcohol ignition interlock device (interlock).).  Interlocks have been commercially available to road users for over ten years.  In 2001, approximately 65,000 interlocks were in use in the United States with 38 North American States having enacted interlock legislation.
