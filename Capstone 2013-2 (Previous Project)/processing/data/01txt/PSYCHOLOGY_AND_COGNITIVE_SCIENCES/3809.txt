This research examined the beliefs differentiating young female undergraduate student binge-drinkers and non-binge-drinkers using Ajzen and Maddenâ€™s (1986) theory of planned behaviour as a theoretical framework. Findings revealed that female students' behavioural and normative beliefs are important determinants of their binge-drinking behaviour. The results of the study suggest that interventions should reduce the emphasis that such students place on the expected benefits of binge-drinking, and highlight the likely disapproval of binge-drinking from referents in their life.
