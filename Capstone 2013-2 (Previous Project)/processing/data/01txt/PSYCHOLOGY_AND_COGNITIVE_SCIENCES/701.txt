Patientsâ€™ knowledge and beliefs about their illnesses are known to influence a range of health related variables, including treatment compliance.  It may therefore be important to quantify these variables to assess their impact on compliance, particularly in chronic illnesses such as Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) that rely on self-administered treatments.  The aim of this study was to develop two new tools, the Apnea Knowledge Test (AKT) and the Apnea Beliefs Scale (ABS), to assess illness knowledge and beliefs in OSA patients.  A systematic test construction process was followed to develop the AKT and the ABS.  This process included consultation with sleep experts and OSA patients.  The psychometric properties of the AKT and ABS were then investigated in a clinical sample of 81 OSA patients and a sample of 33 healthy non-sleep disordered adults.  Results suggest both measures are easily understood by OSA patients, have adequate internal consistency, and are readily accepted by patients.  A preliminary investigation of the validity of these tools conducted by comparing patient data to that of 33 healthy non-sleep disordered adults, revealed that apnea patients knew more about OSA, had more positive attitudes towards continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, and attributed more importance to treating sleep disturbances than non-clinical groups.  Overall, the results of psychometric analyses of these tests suggest these measures will be useful clinical tools with numerous beneficial applications, particularly in CPAP compliance studies and apnea education program evaluations.
