This study aimed to evaluate a standardised sleep apnea patient education program and develop a study design that may be used to evaluate other such education programs.    Thirty-four adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) underwent a standard sleep apnea education program and completed measures of knowledge of and beliefs about sleep apnea before, after, and three-months following education.  Two outcome measures were used; the Apnea Knowledge Test (AKT) and the Apnea Beliefs Scale (ABS).  This study provides the first, albeit preliminary, evaluation of a structured OSAHS patient education program.
