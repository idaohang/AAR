The present investigation aimed to critically examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index â€“ Revised (ASI-R).  Confirmatory factor analysis using a clinical sample of adults (N = 248) revealed that the ASI-R could be improved substantially through the removal of 15 problematic items in order to account for the most robust dimensions of anxiety sensitivity.  This modified scale was re-named the 21-item Anxiety Sensitivity Index (21-item ASI) and re-analysed with a large sample of normative adults (N = 435), revealing configural and metric invariance across groups.  Further, comparisons with other alternative models indicated the 21-item ASI to be the best fitting model for both groups.  There was also evidence of internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity for both samples suggesting that the 21-item ASI is a useful assessment device for investigating the construct of anxiety sensitivity in both clinical and normative populations.
