A significant potential population of d/Deaf** drivers and riders exists both in Australia and internationally. As yet, no systematic investigation of the services available to aid this group in becoming licensed to drive or ride has been completed. The current investigation reviewed the level of services made available through Australian licensing authorities to aid d/Deaf drivers and riders. A search of publicly available licensing information together with direct surveying of customer service representatives in each jurisdiction was used to gain the information. Results indicate that the level of services available varies considerably within Australian licensing authorities. The results are discussed in relation to relevant international licensing practices and possibilities for enhancing available services for d/Deaf clients.
