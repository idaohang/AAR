This paper reports on the design of a prototype VRLE (Virtual Reality Learning Environment) named VRMath. VRMath is an online application that utilises VR (Virtual Reality)technology combined with the power of a Logo-like programming language and hypermedia and the Internet to facilitate the learning of 3-Dimensional (3D) geometry concepts and processes. VRMath is being designed within the framework of a design-experiment (The Design-Based Research Collective, 2003) during which VRMath will evolve through a series of iteration cycles of design Ã  enactment Ã  reflection Ã  redesign into an educational tool that will provide mathematics educators with new and more powerful ways of facilitating the construction of 3D geometry knowledge. During these iteration cycles, in addition to many new ways about thinking and doing mathematics being identified, implications to inform the future design of this and other VRLEs also will emerge.
