Background: Depression is prevalent among university students. It is debilitating and affects the academic performance of students. One of the most common reasons why students consult counselling centres is depression. Therefore it is important to assess the university studentsâ€™ depression by valid measures designed particularly for this purpose.   Method: The present study developed the &quot;University Student Depression Inventory&quot; (USDI) to measure the depressive symptoms of university students.   Result:  Items based on a broad range of depression   symptoms were subjected to factor analysis, resulting in a 30 item scale with three subscales: Lethargy; Cognitive / Emotional; and Academic Motivation.  Psychometric investigation revealed satisfactory reliability and convergent and divergent validity.  Conclusion:  It is expected that multidimensional USDI would be a useful tool for university counselling services to assess the depression of the students.
