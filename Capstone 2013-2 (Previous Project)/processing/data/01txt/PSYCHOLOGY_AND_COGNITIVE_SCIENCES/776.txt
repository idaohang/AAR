The available evidence suggests that people who drive for work purposes engage in less safe driving practices than other drivers.  The study examined this issue by surveying 204 people who drive for work purposes, in four different vehicle fleets. It was predicted that work-related drivers would report a higher intention to speed in a work vehicle than their personal vehicle. Additionally, the constructs within the Theory of Planned Behaviour, along with anticipated regret, were used to predict intentions to speed in the two settings.  Contrary to prediction, the participants reported a lower intention to speed, t (201) = 4.19, p &lt; .001, in a work vehicle than their personal vehicle. Further analysis revealed that the intentions of drivers in the two settings were significantly different in relation to anticipated regret, t (201) = 4.84, p &lt; .001 and subjective norms, t (201) = 4.02, p &lt; .001. Thus it would appear that these two psychological mechanisms discourage speeding behaviour in the work context. However, these findings need to be replicated with a larger sample of drivers from more diverse vehicle fleets.
