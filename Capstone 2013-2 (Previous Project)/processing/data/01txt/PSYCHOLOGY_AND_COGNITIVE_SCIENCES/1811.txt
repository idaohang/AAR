The internationalization of higher education has led to changing roles for academics, including opportunities to participate in international projects. However, the extent to which academics feel prepared for entry into the international arena has received little attention. The purpose of this study was to examine women academicsâ€™ perceptions of barriers, facilitators, and career benefits of pursuing international projects. Thirteen women academics participated in a semi-structured interview which illuminated six core themes depicting the benefits of international roles, influences on motivation, enablers and barriers, expanded personal and academic worldviews perspectives, and ways of gaining international competencies. Suggestions are given for supporting academic women to pursue international opportunities to enhance their academic careers.
