The study investigated the test-reliability and cognitive functioning stability (argued to be separate concepts) of the School-Years Screening Test for the Evaluation of Mental Status for 5 to 8 year old children (n = 135) utilising two different models.  The models developed by Heise and Wiley and Wiley are introduced to the field of psychological research and test development.  Age and total testing time were considered within these models.  Test-reliability was high and cognitive functioning was found to be stable between initial and subsequent testing sessions.
