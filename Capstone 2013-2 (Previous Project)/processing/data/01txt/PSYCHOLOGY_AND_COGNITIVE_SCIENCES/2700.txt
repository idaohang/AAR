This paper argues that the driving task exhibits the  properties of complex systems. Driving behavior emerges from the  intricate and complex interactions between the driver, the vehicle  and the environment. An emerging driving behavior could not  necessary be linearly predicted. However a  context-aware system  could assist the driver in augmenting the probability of undertaking  safe behavior. Unlike existing context aware systems which isolate  one  characteristic  such as road  or driver workload and  concentrate on it in exclusion of the others factors, this seminal  research proposes a context awareness design which considers the  driver, vehicle and environment as a whole. We focus on the  principles that underlie the system in order to model it with the  view of understanding, predicting and improving  driver behavior.  This approach places context-aware design within a wider framework  that takes into account information related to the driver,  environment and vehicle. It recommends approaches for building  safety critical context-aware systems. Such an approach aids in the  design of safe in-vehicle context-aware systems.
