Objective: Explores the impact of pre-migration trauma, post-migration living difficulties and social support on the current mental health of 63 resettled Sudanese refugees.  Method: A semi structured interview including questionnaires assessing socio demographic information, pre-migration trauma, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress, post-migration living difficulties and perceived social support were administered assisted by a bilingual community worker.  Results: Resettled refugees from Sudan evidenced a history of trauma. Less than 5% met criteria for post-traumatic stress but 25% reported clinically high levels of psychological distress. The results indicate that social support â€“ particularly perceived social support from the migrantâ€™s ethnic community â€“ play a significant role in predicting mental health outcomes. Pre-migration trauma, family status, and gender were also associated with mental health outcomes.  Conclusions: Refugees in Australia may constitute a particularly vulnerable group in terms of mental health outcomes.  Culturally specific sequelae in terms of social isolation and acculturation may be particularly problematic for these migrants.
