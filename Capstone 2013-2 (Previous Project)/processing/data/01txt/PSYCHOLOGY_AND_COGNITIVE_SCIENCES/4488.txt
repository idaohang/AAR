The current research aimed to examine evidence for the construct validity of the three-factor model of social identity as measured by the Three Dimensional Strength of Group Identification Scale proposed by Cameron (2004). The 12 item version of the Three Dimensional Strength of Group Identification Scale was used to collect data from an undergraduate sample (N = 219) to assess their social identification across three distinct group memberships. This data was subjected to Confirmatory Factor Analysis to examine the fit of the three-factor model of social identity in comparison to fit indices for one and two-factor models. The results indicate that the three-factor model is the most parsimonious and best fit to the data, providing empirical support for the hypothesized three-factor structure of social identity. In addition, the fact that different patterns of means and correlations emerged across groups emerged on the three dimensions, provides further evidence for a multidimensional model of social identification.
