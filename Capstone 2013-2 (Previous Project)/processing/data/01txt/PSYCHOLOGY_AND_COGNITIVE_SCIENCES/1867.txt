The present study investigates the career maturity of 1090 high school students in Years 8 to 12 in Australia (n = 656) and South Africa (n = 434). Scores on the Australian version of the Career Development Inventory were analysed. While a developmental explanation for career maturity was supported, gender differences between countries and differences at school transition points were found. The relevance of school career education programs to prepare students for career decisions is discussed.
