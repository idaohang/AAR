This paper reports on a further exploration into the reliability and validity of the shortened form of the Career Development Inventory - Australia (Creed &amp; Patton, 2004), a career maturity measure being developed to meet the need for a shorter and up-to-date measure to provide data on this career development construct. Data gathered from 170 final year education students (34 males, 132 females) provided partial support for the measureâ€™s internal consistency, factor structure and construct validity.
