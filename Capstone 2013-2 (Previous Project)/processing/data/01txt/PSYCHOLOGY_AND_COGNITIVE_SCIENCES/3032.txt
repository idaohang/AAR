To date, employee innovation research has been dominated by two research questions: What factors increase the novelty and usefulness of innovation outcomes?; and What factors increase the innovativeness of employees? While the answers to these questions are important, we argue that other questions remain unanswered and that innovative innovation research is needed. We discuss traditional methods of studying innovation and argue that a new method, diary studies, may be more useful at answering these neglected questions. We outline considerations involved in diary studies and then provide a case study where diary methods were successfully used to study employee innovation.
