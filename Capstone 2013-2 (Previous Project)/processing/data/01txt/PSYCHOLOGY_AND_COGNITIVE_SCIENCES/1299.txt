This paper will outline a research in progress that explores the psychological barriers that prevent people within community from integrating information and communication technology into their lives.  The research will use the Social Cognitive Theory by Bandura (1986) to examine the psychology of the digital divide.  This theory postulates that a person will act according to their perceived capabilities and the anticipated consequences of their actions.  Participants in the study will be members of the Brisbane community.  Self-administered surveys will be used for data collection. The surveys will gather data on demographics, Internet usage and Internet self-efficacy.  As part of its commitment to developing the Smart City, the Brisbane City Council (BCC) provides support to the current research project by allowing participants to be drawn from the 32 branches of the BCC library service.  The current research is significant, as it will expand current understanding of a phenomenon that has far reaching social and economic implications.  This research will aid in developing a clearer and more comprehensive picture of the digital divide, which will allow organisations, such as public libraries, to better develop and tailor services and programs to more accurately and effectively narrow the gap between the information rich and information poor in society.  Thus, allowing all members of community to have an equal chance of establishing and maintaining productive personal and professional lives in this rapidly emerging digital age.
