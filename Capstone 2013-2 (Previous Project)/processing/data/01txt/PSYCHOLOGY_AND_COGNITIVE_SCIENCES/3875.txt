The relationship between perfectionism and negative emotional states was investigated in 405 male and female Australian University students, using a multidimensional measure of perfectionism, and two measures of emotional distress.  There was a significant positive association between perfectionism and (a) depression, (b) anxiety, and (c) stress. This result was independent of age or gender, with the exception of stress. These results and their implications for future research and the treatment of students with high levels of perfectionism are discussed.
