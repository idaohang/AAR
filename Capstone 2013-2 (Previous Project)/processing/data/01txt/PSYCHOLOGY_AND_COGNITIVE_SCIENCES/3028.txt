Creativity research has a long and illustrious history, yet the assumptions on which it is based have not been questioned. Most research assumes that creativity is a unitary construct, hindering a fuller understanding of the phenomenon. The present paper argued against homogeneity through the development of a matrix of four creativity types: responsive, expected, contributory and proactive. Implications include highlighting an imbalance in research, differences in processes and predictors for the various types and a new consideration of methodologies.
