In 1999 a national survey of 2,100 members of the Australian Psychological Society (APS) was undertaken to investigate Australian psychologistsâ€™ ethical beliefs and behaviours (Sullivan, 2002).  As part of this survey, participants were asked to rate the usefulness of various sources of ethics information.  Approximately six hundred respondents answered this section of the survey, indicating Australian psychologists consider a range of sources of information about ethics useful and favour discussions with colleagues.  Results are discussed in relation to findings from overseas surveys that have also addressed this issue, and several recommendations are made about future ethics education.
