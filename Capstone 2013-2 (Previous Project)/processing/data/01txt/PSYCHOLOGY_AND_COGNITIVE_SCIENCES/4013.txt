Recent career theory literature has documented the rise of the â€˜proteanâ€™ or â€˜boundarylessâ€™ career, typified by subjective, psychological motivators and measures of success (with an emphasis on personally meaningful life/work), high levels of personal responsibility for career development and low job security. There is strong evidence to suggest that creative and performing artists often fit into this new careerist model (e.g., Bridgstock, 2005). Tertiary graduates in arts will emerge into a highly competitive and uncertain working world, with nearly half of all creative and performing arts graduates still seeking full-time employment four months after finishing university (all other fields 20% - Graduate Careers Council of Australia, 2005). This study surveyed 180 students finishing undergraduate degrees in applied arts at three universities in terms of their orientation towards the protean career, and their beliefs regarding the essential precursors of a successful career in arts. Technical/ industrial arts (design, multimedia, film &amp; television) graduates face similar career challenges to creative and performing arts graduates and have similar needs in terms of career management education, but arts / education students do not fit this profile. Participants recognised the importance of a protean career orientation and were fairly confident about their abilities to navigate their careers, though a significant proportion had not yet worked in their chosen field/s. Recommendations for arts industry work experience or internship programs for applied arts students and further research are made.
