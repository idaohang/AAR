The current investigation sought to determine whether any observable gender differences existed in the expression of symptoms, cognitions, and sensitivity towards anxiety for a nonclinical sample of 50 males and 50 females, matched for age and social desirability response bias.  To investigate this, a between groups study was employed which compared the male and female groups on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck &amp; Steer, 1993); Catastrophic Cognitions Questionnaire â€“Modified (Khawaja, Oei &amp; Banglioni, 1994); Anxiety Sensitivity Index (Reiss, Peterson, Gurskey &amp; McNally, 1986); and Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (Crowne &amp; Marlowe, 1960).  Multivariate analyses of variance revealed that females reported higher concern than males regarding the cognitive misinterpretation of the symptoms and beliefs of anxiety.  In the context of these results, it would appear that cognitive factors play the most important role towards our understanding of gender differences in anxiety within the nonclinical population.  The strengths, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.
