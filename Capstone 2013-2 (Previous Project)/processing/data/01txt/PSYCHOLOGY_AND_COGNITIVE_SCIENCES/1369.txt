Early onset of antisocial behaviour is associated with an increased likelihood of chronic, persistent and violent offending across the life course. Despite this, many individuals who exhibit early onset do not persist, demonstrating recovery from early risk. This research examines the characteristics of those individuals who exhibit early risk and describes how these characteristics vary by gender. Moffittâ€™s dual typology of life-course-persistent (LCP) and adolescence-limited (AL) antisocial behaviour is examined using data from the Mater-University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP). This prospective longitudinal study includes data on mother/child pairs spanning from pre-natal period to when the child was 14 years of age. Characteristics of these groups are examined in an attempt to understand the recovery of those who begin life on the LCP trajectory. Those who recover have: families with better communication; parents with fewer arrests; later onset of puberty; higher levels of cognitive functioning; lower levels of internalising and alienation; more close friends; and lower school and neighbourhood delinquency.
