In this study two potential indices of malingering derived from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) were evaluated as a means of detecting malingering.  These were indices based on: discrepancies between recognition-recall scores, and differences in the serial position effect (SPE).  Sixty undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: malingerers, malingerers-with-warnings, warning-only, and control.  Incentives were offered to participants in all conditions to encourage faking in a believable manner (malingering conditions), or to encourage optimal performance (non-malingering conditions).  Two predictions were made.  First, it was predicted that the serial position curve for subjects in malingering conditions would show suppression of primacy effects relative to non-malingerers.  Second, it was predicted that recall would be better than recognition for subjects in malingering but not non-malingerers conditions.  The utility of these indices was also explored in the context of providing subjectsâ€™ with warnings regarding use of methods to detect malingering.  Results indicated that both indices failed to reliably differentiate between malingerers and non-malingerers, and warnings failed to modify participants' behaviour
