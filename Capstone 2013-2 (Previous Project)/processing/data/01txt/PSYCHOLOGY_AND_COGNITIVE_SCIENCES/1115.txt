Logical Memory (LM) is the most frequently administered subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale; however the lack of alternate equivalent forms for this subtest may limit its clinical utility.  Six new paragraphs modelled on LM stories were developed.  Stories were matched on attributes such as number of words and readability.  Passage attributes for the six stories were compared with those of standard LM stories (WMS-R and WMS-III versions) to examine story equivalence.  The psychometric properties of new passages were also calculated to assess task difficulty and interrater reliability.  Results from these analyses suggest a high degree of overlap between the attributes of the new stories and some interesting discrepancies between passage attributes of WMS-R and WMS-III LM stories.  In addition, interrater reliability of new passages was found to be excellent (at least .97), and when combined into three sets of passage-pairs, these pairs were found have equivalent difficulty.  To reduce the potential for practice effects by use of alternate forms, these new logical memory-style passages may be particularly useful for repeat assessment of auditory-verbal memory.
