The ongoing social and financial costs of work-related motor vehicle accidents are substantial. This project investigates the relationship between the frequently used intervention of driver education and motor vehicle fleet safety climate. The findings of the present study suggest that within the context of an Australian emergency services fleet, driver education is related to employeesâ€™ perceptions of fleet safety climate.   More specifically, the provision of education is associated with increased employees' perceptions in relation to management commitment, appropriate work demands and trusting relationships and communications. Finally, the findings from the present study indicate that the fleet safety climate scale may be a useful measure for Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) personnel interested in identifying where safety enhancements are required or for benchmarking employeesâ€™ safety perceptions.
