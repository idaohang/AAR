In the present prospective study of 81 older volunteers from a nonprofit organization in Australia, the authors compared the predictive utility of I. Ajzenâ€™s (1988) theory of planned behavior with that of E. G. Clary and M. Snyderâ€™s (1991) functional approach to volunteering. The authors mailed questionnaires to 385 volunteers in two waves of data collection. The first wave measured the theory-of-planned-behavior variables and the functional-approach variables. The second wave measured self-reported volunteering behavior for the previous month. Regression analyses supported both the theory of planned behavior and the functional approach; the theory of planned behavior accounted for a significantly larger proportion of variance in above-average participation in self-reported volunteerism. The findings of the present study provided some support for both the theory of planned behavior and the functional approach as models of self-reported volunteerism.
