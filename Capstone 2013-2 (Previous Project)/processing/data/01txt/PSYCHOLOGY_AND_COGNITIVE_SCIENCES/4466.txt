The twin scales, Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ) and Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ) (Chambless, Caputo, Bright &amp; Gallagher, 1984) have been used frequently in the area of anxiety, and in particular, panic disorder with agoraphobia. The present study employed confirmatory factor analysis to investigate the factor structure of the scales on a sample of Australian anxiety disorder patients.  Model testing indicated that neither the original nor the modified factor structures offered a good fit to the data.    In addition, confirmatory factor analyses highlighted statistical inconsistencies in the scales. Except for a few, most of the items were problematic. This indicated a need for possible revision of the scales. Moreover, until further research is conducted, researchers and clinicians are recommended to use the scales with caution.
