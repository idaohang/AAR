There is minimal evidence to show that instructional design (where communication and critical thinking is a crucial part of the learning process in the classroom) has catered for ethnic groups for whom English is not their first language. Computer-mediated communication can provide a social aspect to learning where interaction involves an exchange of information and requires participants to formulate arguments or reorganise material to arrive at new relationships or concepts (Graham &amp; Scarborough, 1999).  This paper demonstrates the use of the video and online discussion forums as part of a â€˜layered learning techniqueâ€™ as a tool for developing critical thinking. It shows the results of a pilot study of how prior exposure to activities and materials integrated within a structured online discussion forum can effectively facilitate interaction and discourse among students of ethnic origins and help them acquire critical thinking skills.
