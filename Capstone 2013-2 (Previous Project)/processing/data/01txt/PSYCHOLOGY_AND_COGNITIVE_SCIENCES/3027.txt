In this paper we describe the development of two new measures of innovation trust, â€˜trust that heardâ€™ and â€˜trust that benefitâ€™.  We report the findings from their use in a survey of design engineers in two large aerospace companies.  We test a range of hypotheses covering different plausible roles for trust and confirm a â€˜main effectsâ€™ model, whereby the variables predict the number of ideas suggested and the number of ideas implemented.  In addition, we replicate earlier findings by Axtell et al. (2000), namely that personal and job variables predict idea suggestion, whilst organisational variables predict implementation.
