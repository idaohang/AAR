This paper describes a solution-focused approach in telephone counselling that can be  used in conjunction with traditional telephone counselling approaches which focus on  listening, reflecting feelings and contents. The solution focused approach may assist in  educating and empowering clients by getting clients to do what they are already doing  that is working, reconnect them to their resources, and encourage them to do something  differently. This approach can increase the collaboration between the counsellor and  client during a telephone counselling session.
