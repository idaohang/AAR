The present study examined whether wording changes in a self-report anxiety scale for children were better able to distinguish anxious from non-anxious children than traditional wording. Furthermore, the study explored whether phrasing the items as either stimulus or consequences (outcomes) of events, would give a better assessment of fear and anxiety in children and adolescents. The four questionnaires were administered to an anxiety-disordered group and a non-anxious group of children aged from 6 to 15 years. Anxious children reported that they thought more about negative outcomes than non-anxious children. However, there were no differences in scores between the two groups using stimulus items. All children regarded negative physical consequences as aversive. However, anxious children reported thinking more frequently about negative physical outcomes than did non-anxious children. All children also thought about negative social outcomes. However, anxiety-disordered children rated negative social outcomes as more aversive than did non- anxious children. None of the four measures discriminated between the different anxiety disorders. Implications for childrenâ€™s self-report data on anxiety are discussed.
