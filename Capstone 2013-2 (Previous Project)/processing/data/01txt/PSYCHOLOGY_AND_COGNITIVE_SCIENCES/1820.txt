The Systems Theory Framework (STF) of career development represents a metatheoretical account of career development that is consistent with the constructivist worldview. Presented as a framework of influences, the STF clearly illustrates the content and process of career development. The STF has provided the stimulus for the development of a qualitative career assessment process, a guided reflection titled My System of Career Influences (MSCI) (McMahon, Patton, &amp; Watson, 2003). Using the content subsystems as aspects in a process of guided reflection, clients engage in the construction of their own career stories by reflecting on their system of career influences. Reflection on the meaning of these influences is guided by a series of questions. The MSCI reflection activity may be completed individually, in groups, or with the assistance of a career counsellor or career teacher. The development and trialling of the MSCI will be outlined in this paper.
