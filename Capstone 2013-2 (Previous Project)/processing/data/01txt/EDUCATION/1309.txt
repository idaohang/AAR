This chapter argues that environmental education is an issue of profound importance, especially for young children, the inheritors of great possibilities, but also of major social and environmental problems and challenges. The author observes that, despite little intersection between early childhood education and environmental education, these two fields are natural allies, sharing common philosophical orientations and endorsing similar educational practices. In reconceptualising early childhood education to take account of environmental concerns, there needs, however, to be a refocus on outdoor play, better provision of natural playspaces for children, and a broadening of the term â€˜environmentâ€™ to encompass holistic and intergenerational perspectives. It is imperative that early childhood teacher education, both preservice and inservice, be transformed to incorporate futures-oriented environmental education principles and practices.
