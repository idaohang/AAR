In this paper I examine pedagogic work of the education export industry through an analysis of interview accounts provided by Western women teachers working offshore in Indonesia.  Specifically, I examine one component of pedagogic work, that is, the construction of classroom knowledge about cross-cultural issues. Specifically, my interest is in examining the ways in which historically constituted power relations between Western teacher and Indonesian student, and the current epoch of a global knowledge economy, impact on the selection and construction of cross-cultural classroom knowledge.  I ask who inhabits the space of Australian offshore higher education in Jakarta, Indonesia; what is the content and form of pedagogic relations in these spaces, what is sayable and speakable to whom, and how, and consequently what types of pedagogic innovations are imaginable?
