This paper seeks to examine the ways in which the idea of the child as high vulnerable to risk is constituting new pedagogical subjects, ie, the teacher/caregiver as a professional risk-manager, and the child as a risk-management â€˜caseâ€™. It does so by indicating how an expanded notion of the duty of care has reconstituted the child as a work-in-progress case rather than 'the concrete subject of [educational] intervention' (Castel, 1991: 288). It examines how the new teacher as a risk-conscious professional caregiver both needs and comes to acquire a new intimacy with the child not as a fleshly body but as a case of risk minimisation.
