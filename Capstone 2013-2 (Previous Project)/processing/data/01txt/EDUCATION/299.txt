This paper reports on child data generated in a pilot project of the ACCESS Study of Child and Family Services, an investigation of the degree to which child and family services meet user needs within local communities. Based on theoretical perspectives drawn from social capital theories, the pilot study was undertaken by a partnership of local early childhood services within the precinct of Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane (Australia) and included two childcare centres, two kindergartens/preschools, one playgroup and one primary school. 76 children aged three to eight years were asked, in informal conversations with their caregivers, to comment on their experiences in the service and to consider possible advice they might give to children coming into the service. Theoretical perspectives from the sociology of childhood are used to examine childrenâ€™s accounts of their lived experience in early childhood services.
