In a knowledge-based, networked economy, students leaving university need to have attained skills in collaborative and creative project-based work and to have developed critical, reflective practices. This paper outlines how a wiki can been used as part of social constructivist pedagogical practice which aims to develop advanced ICT literacies in university students. The paper describes the implementation of a wiki-based project as part of a subject in New Media Technologies at Queensland University of Technology. We discuss the strengths and challenges involved in using networked, collaborative learning strategies in institutional environments that still operate in traditional paradigms.
