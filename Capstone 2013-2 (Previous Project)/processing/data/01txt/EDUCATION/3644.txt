This essay advances a number of reasons for the establishment of a professional peace research organization in Australia, including 1) promotion of peace research in Australia, 2) input into public policy, such as with the Australian National Commission for UNESCO, and 3) the promotion of peace and social justice in Australian public discourse. A number of possibilities are discussed, although the recommended option in this essay is for the formation of an Australian Council for Peace Research and Education.
