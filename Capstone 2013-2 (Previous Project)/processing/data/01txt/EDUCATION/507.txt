Speech, language and communication are essential conduits for all students to learn and socialize in a school setting. Access to the rich and interactive culture of learning in Australian schools for some students with a hearing impairment is achieved through the use of the Australian Sign Language System or Auslan. Members of the deaf community who use Auslan believe that it is a superior form of communication to any other because it involves signing and body gestures. They take pride in the fluency and quality of expression they are able to achieve through the use of Auslan and regard the Auslan expressions as an important foundation for deaf culture.
