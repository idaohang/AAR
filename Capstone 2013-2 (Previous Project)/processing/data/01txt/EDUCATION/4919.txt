Pattern exploration is advocated as an essential element of young childrenâ€™s mathematical development. However, past research has shed little light on the effect that mathematical patterning experiences can have on the development of childrenâ€™s understanding of specific mathematical concepts. This paper explores the content of mathematical patterning experiences that were observed in a multi-site case study conducted in Australian preparatory and preschool classrooms with similarly aged children. These experiences were analysed to ascertain the potential contribution they make to algebraic development. From the results, it appears that the content of these mathematical patterning experiences in prior-to-school environments, provide limited connections to algebraic thinking.
