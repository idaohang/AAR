This paper points to a new discursive order in teacher education policy and professional development practice which is actively producing teachers as 'corporatising' professionals. The authors note certain rhetoric shifts in Australian teacher education policy which, they argue, constitute quite a radical departure from notions of the professional worker which proliferated less than a decade ago. Drawing on Foucauldian notions of the discursive nature of knowledge and identity formation, they discuss the implications of this rhetorical shift in terms of its impact on  the 'professional' identity of the teacher.
