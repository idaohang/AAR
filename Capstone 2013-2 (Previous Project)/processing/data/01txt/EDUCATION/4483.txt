Literacy &amp; Education: Understanding the New Literacy Studies in the Classroom (Pahl &amp; Rowsell, 2005) advances an approach to multiliteracies education that has application from the middle years of schooling.  Pahl &amp; Rowsell add to the call for teachers &amp; curriculum planners to build programs around local &amp; individual difference as opposed to a standardized, one-size-fits-all approach.  The authors argue that commonplace autonomous models of literacy dictate terms for the reader, whereas in an ideological model of literacy the reader &amp; the context dictate the terms of how a text is read &amp; understood.  â€˜Such a shift in thinking gives more power to the reader &amp; the context as carriers of their own meanings, discourses &amp; ideologies (Pahl &amp; Rowsell, 2005, p. 79).  As Jim Cummins (2005, p. 151) summarises in the afterwords, Pahl &amp; Rowsell provide a radically different image of the literacy student, an image that is intelligent, imaginative &amp; linguistically talented.  This text also outlines pedagogies &amp; strategies for building on studentsâ€™ individual cultural &amp; linguistic capital, promoting cognitive engagement &amp; identity investment where students are able to employ a range of technical tools to be constructors &amp; researchers of knowledge.  As Allan Luke argues in the foreword, such provision is essential if we are to abide by our commitment to literacy as a means of social transformation.
