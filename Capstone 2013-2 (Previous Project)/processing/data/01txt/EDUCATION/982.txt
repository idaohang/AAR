From a discourse analysis of promotional materials that include prospectuses, advertisements and school publications, this paper considers the 'value-addedness' of emotional literacy that some schools in Australia purport to offer as they position themselves at the apex of the market of education. Attesting to the importance of obtaining positional advantage, ideas of building self-esteem as emotional intelligence are being conflated with religious principles to produce the 'whole' child with market edge. This paper draws on a recent research study of 'elite' Australian schools and traces discursive shifts that re-form and link formerly 'unpopular' ideas about religion with those of contemporary understandings of spirituality as emotional intelligence. Some schools go further to offer emotional literacy as part of their pedagogy. Questions are raised in the paper about issues of fabrication in performativity-inspired marketing materials that promise to build subjective identities with a spiritual dimension that translates into successful and prosperous schooling outcomes and life chances.
