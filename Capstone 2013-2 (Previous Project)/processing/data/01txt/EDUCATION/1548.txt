For citizens of nations functioning with advanced liberal, knowledge-based economies a dominant theme is the exhortation to become reflexive, self-maximising subjects. This reflexive and self-maximising subject, who is increasingly thought of as separated from institutional and structural constraint as a free and individual agent, has become the valorised citizen of western politics and policy. Some researchers regard this shift in understanding of citizenship as a detraditionalisation; or an unhooking of traditional social roles and relationships, such as gender, from individuals. Others argue that it is instead a more complex process of both detraditionalisation and retraditionalisation; that is â€˜unhookingsâ€™ combined and in conflict with reinforcings of â€˜traditionâ€™.    One site in which these shifts in thinking about subjectivity can be explicated is in the arena of womenâ€™s labour, motherhood and ECEC. This paper seeks to make an analysis of the way in which Australian governments are â€˜problematisingâ€™ ECEC in advanced liberalism, taking account of the complex combination of detraditionalisation and retraditionalisation across womenâ€™s labour, motherhood and ECEC policy.
