With the recent push for schools and teachers to play an active and positive role towards reconciliation between Australiaâ€™s traditional land owners and the more recent arrivals, it is more necessary than ever for teachers to better understand the multiple viewpoints and the complex issues that surround such a topic.  IFTE 2003 provided many sessions where literacy teachers could hear from a diverse range of Aboriginal Australians.  For me, such an opportunity was a crucial part of developing a better understandings about my role as a literacy teacher in these New Times.  I have titled my review of five of these sessions as â€˜Hearing Silencesâ€™.  This was because IFTE 2003 provided a forum for Aboriginal Australians to talk about what literacy teachers should do for Aboriginal students in particular and for non-Aboriginal students in general.
