Qualitative data analysis has become increasingly important in mathematics education research.  However the conceptualisation of the data and the fulfillment of the interactive assumption of qualitative analysis are a concern.  An alternative to a linguistic approach to analysis is a visual approach.  The visual analysis of data utilises wholistic data displays, referred to as data maps, and employs visual reasoning.  The data maps, which are produced using drawing software, can enhance conceptualisation and facilitate the interactive process of analysis.
