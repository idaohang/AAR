The Northern Corridor Education Precinct (NCEP) is an initiative of education providers in the area from Brisbaneâ€™s CBD to Caboolture.  This area encompasses forty-five government and non government schools, nine TAFE campuses, and two university campuses, and a shared campus between TAFE and the Queensland University of Technology (QUT).    The NCEP has emerged at a time of unprecedented systemic and jurisdictional review of all educational sectors at both the national and state level in Australia. Although this presents challenges, it is also a significant opportunity to continue advances towards cross-sectoral and regional relationships and outcomes.    One of the main strengths of the NCEP is the open and representative nature of the NCEP Steering Committee.  The collaborative and sectoral outlook of the group opens up dialogue and innovation, historically difficult to achieve in a traditional model.      This paper will highlight the Cabbage Tree Creek Learning Precinct Project as one of the NCEPâ€™s initiatives.  This project involves integrating enterprise education concepts into school curriculum to provide â€˜real lifeâ€™ learning opportunities based around a shared physical resource for students of the four education sectors and our communities.
