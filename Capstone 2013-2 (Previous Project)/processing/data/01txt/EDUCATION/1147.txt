This paper reports on a study of Year 3 and 4 studentsâ€™ addition and subtraction mental computation.  The purpose of the study was to investigate the cognitive aspects of the mental computation conceptual frameworks that the author formulated from a study of Year 3 students who were accurate in their mental computation.  These frameworks had accounted for differing levels of flexibility in mental computation.
