&quot;Case study&quot; has many descriptive functions (e.g., case record, discussion stimulus, research report, research tool) and can be used to generate theory.  However, case study also has a critical role in testing theory.  Here, I discuss a case study that was used to test an instructional theory in mathematics derived from the literature.  Theory testing involved operationalising the theory as an intervention and determining support for assertions related to the instructional goals.  The case study supported some theoretical components and provided explanations that led to the revision of other components.  Hence, case study - beyond description - has analytic generalisability.
