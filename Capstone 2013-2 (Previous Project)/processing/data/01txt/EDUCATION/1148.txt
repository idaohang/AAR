Flexibility in strategy choice in mental computation is considered to be a component of number sense.  This paper reports on an investigation into cognitive, metacognitive, and affective factors that support both flexibility and accuracy in mental addition and subtraction in Year 3 students.  While some factors appeared to be essential for flexibility, additional factors were necessary for accurate employment of strategies.  Further, there were qualitative differences between the mental strategies employed by the students who were accurate and those who were inaccurate.
