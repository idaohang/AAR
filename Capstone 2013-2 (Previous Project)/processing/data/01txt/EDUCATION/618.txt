This paper proposes that the achievement of healthy, just and sustainable futures may be supported by shifting the emphasis in our education systems from acceptance of current ecologically unsustainable and socially inequitable patterns and structures, towards the creation and acceptance of more sustainable practices and systems. This paper describes two recent educational innovations (Health Promoting Schools, and Futures Studies) which offer frameworks for social change which can assist educators, parents, futurists and community groups to conceptualise and implement the socially-critical stances necessary for achieving alternative futures.  This paper describes areas of correspondence and potential synergy between these innovations, and proposes that educators interested in socially-critical stances consider adopting both approaches in their school communities.
