With the emergence of sociological and economic change there is increasing attention given to governance of childrenâ€™s spaces in recent years. This paper discusses these changes and how they have impacted on, and contributed to, this increased interest. The paper draws on the sociology of childhood framework in order to examine how children themselves actively respond to and participate in enacting governance within school spaces and also within their own peer cultures. It addresses an in-progress study being undertaken to explore young childrenâ€™s everyday interactions within an early childhood setting.
