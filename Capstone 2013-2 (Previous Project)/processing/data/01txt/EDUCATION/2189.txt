The use of on-line design journals has the potential to promote socio-constructivist approaches to learning and teaching. In the first semester of 2005 I set-up an initiative in my Informational Arts unit at QUT where students were encouraged to publish on-line design journals. The students were asked to research examples of applied research and document their findings to share with their classmates. To help them do this I provided them with links of numerous national and international applied research centres. I also encouraged them to review my own design journal that I use to publish references to significant cultural, philosophical and technical works. I was keen for the students to start situating themselves as practitioners and researchers within the broader field of design enquiry. Students in design programmes often find it difficult to make connections between their student practice and the practice of professionals and researchers. This initiative was designed for this reason, to support the students in their discovery. The students were able to use the publishing process as a method for understanding their own enquiry and research interests. They were able to discover their own points of departure from existing research through personal reflection and peer feedback. The use of on-line design journals seemed to have a number of benefits: they allowed students to incrementally find research directions and establish research paths; they provided students with a vehicle for promoting informal debate and discussion; and they helped them to establish their own voice as practitioners and potential applied researchers.
