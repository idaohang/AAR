This paper reports on a study of seven Year 3 studentsâ€™ diminished performance in addition and subtraction mental computation. Although all students were identified as being inaccurate, three students used some variety of mental strategies, while the other students used only one strategy that reflected the written procedure for each of the addition and subtraction algorithms taught in the classroom. Interviews were used to identify studentsâ€™ knowledge and ability with respect to number sense (including numeration, number and operations, basic facts, estimation), metacognition, affects, and memory. Two conceptual frameworks were developed, one representing the flexible mental computers, and the other representing the inflexible mental computers. These frameworks identified factors and relationships between factors that influence flexibility in these inaccurate mental computers. The frameworks were compared with a framework of an ideal mental computer. These frameworks showed that inaccuracy resulted from disconnected and deficient cognitive, metacognitive, and affective factors; and in some cases might have been affected by deficient short-term memory. It appeared that studentsâ€™ choices of mental strategies resulted from different forms of compensation for varying levels of deficiencies.
