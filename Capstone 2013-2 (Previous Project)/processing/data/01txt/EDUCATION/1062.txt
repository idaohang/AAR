In 1997, a teaching program at a large metropolitan university in Australia was implemented to encourage teacher education students to reflect on their epistemological beliefs in the context of an educational psychology unit. This program was designed to help student teachers develop more constructivist beliefs about knowing and teaching over the year-long program. All students were interviewed at the beginning (Time 1) and end (Time 2) of the year-long teaching program and also asked to write journal reflections about their beliefs about knowing and teaching. This paper is an analysis of the changes in epistemological beliefs that occurred for two student teachers who were involved in the teaching program. The analysis of the interviews and journals indicated that both students held a range of epistemological beliefs however one student described an increased focus on constructivist beliefs about knowing and teaching throughout the year.
