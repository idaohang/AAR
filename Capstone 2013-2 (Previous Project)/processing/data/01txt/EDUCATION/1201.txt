A number of writers have drawn attention to the increasing importance of language in social life in â€˜new timesâ€™ and Fairclough (2001b) has referred to â€˜discourse drivenâ€™ social change.  These conditions have led to an increase in the use of various forms of discourse analysis in policy analysis.  This paper explores the possibilities of using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) in critical policy research in education, drawing on a larger research project which is investigating the equity implications of Education Queenslandâ€™s reform agenda.  It is argued that in the context of new times, CDA is of particular value in documenting multiple and competing discourses in policy texts, in highlighting marginalised and hybrid discourses, and in documenting discursive shifts in policy implementation processes.  The last part of the paper discusses how such research might be used by policy activists inside and outside education department bureaucracies to further social democratic goals.
