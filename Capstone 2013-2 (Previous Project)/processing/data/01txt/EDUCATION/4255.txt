This paper reports on an investigation of the nature and extent of teacherâ€™s knowledge of mathematical patterning and how this knowledge is applied in their daily planning and day-to-day interactions with children. Two case studies indicated that teachers acknowledged the salient role of mathematical patterning and were satisfied with their understanding of patterning processes. However observation of these teachersâ€™ classes suggests that there were limited worthwhile patterning opportunities for children.
