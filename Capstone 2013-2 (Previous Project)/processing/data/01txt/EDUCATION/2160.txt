This paper describes some of the current problems with the assessment of childrenâ€™s anxiety. The main assessment methods - structured clinical interview and self-report - often have problems with validity and reliability while less frequently used measures, such as physiological recording, behavioural observation, and thought-listing also have their attendant difficulties. Possible ways of reducing some of these problems using a developmental perspective are discussed.
