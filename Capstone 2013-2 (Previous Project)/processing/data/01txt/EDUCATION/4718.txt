How can an undergraduate course and its technology-integrated learning design strengthen the student-university-industry triad?  This paper describes the Brisbane Media Map, (http://bmm.qut.edu.au), an authentic learning project in which undergraduate media students work as a team to design and populate an online directory of Brisbaneâ€™s media sector. The paper focuses on the pedagogical design, assessment and management, and technological architectural of the Map Project and its implications for strengthening university-industrial relations in an urban area.
