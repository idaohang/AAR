The research entailed a student learning task involving either a â€˜static-plus-textâ€™ or an â€˜interrelatedâ€™ computer-based instructional (CBI) activity about the human brain.  Eighty-four Year 8 students from Brisbane participated, working in either of two instruction formats, static-plus-text (n = 44) or interrelated (n = 40) with relatively equal number of girls (51%) and boys (49%).  A test of learning, in the form of recognition, recall and application sub-tests, was administered to students following participation in the CBI activity.  The test of learning results showed a noteworthy difference between the two instructional formats.  When the sub-tests were analysed by instructional format a MANOVA calculation showed a significant difference between the three sub-tests, and the sub-tests by group. Overall, there were major differences between the two instructional formats for the recognition and application sub-tests but not for the recall sub-test.  Students in the interrelated instructional group were better at recognising material and at applying the information learned.  This research has implications for the design of computer based instructional materials.
