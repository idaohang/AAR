This paper examines three factors driving Australian universities generally, and Faculties of Education specifically, to develop explicit higher degree research (HDR) training curricula. These three factors are (1) the imperatives of the knowledge or informational economy, (2) national policies based on progress and performance measures and (3) accountability to knowledge users/consumers.     A case study of how one institution responded to these demands in terms of an explicit, structured HDR training program is explored. Specifically the paper examines the design of the HDR curriculum, its enactment and outcomes. It is argued that research supervision should be regarded as one of the most complex and advanced forms of teaching, and one that requires urgent attention.
