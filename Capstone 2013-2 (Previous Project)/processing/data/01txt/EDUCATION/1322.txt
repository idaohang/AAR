The Queensland University of Technology (QUT) challenges its teachers to provide innovative and dynamic learning environments that foster excellence in student learning. This paper discusses how the Faculty of Information Technology is using collaborative teaching and learning strategies to meet this challenge. The paper explores how team teaching and learning is being implemented within the Graduate Diploma in Library and Information Studies. The core unit ITN336 Information Resources is used as a case study. The paper discusses the practical implications of incorporating team teaching into a unit's curriculum and how it impacts on the teaching and learning process. Student attitudes towards team teaching are explored. The paper concludes by discussing how team teaching is not just a technique that can be applied to divide the labour within a unit, rather it is a creative and thoughtful mechanism for fostering a dynamic studentcentred learning environment.
