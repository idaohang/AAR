This article issues from a doctoral research journey concerned with the design of school libraries. It is a point-in-time opportunity to explore, raise questions and invite conversation. On an earlier 20+ year journey the writer worked as a teacher-librarian and school library consultant with Brisbane Catholic Education and co-principal researcher with QUT colleagues in the â€˜Performing hybridityâ€™ study (2000-1). The study recognised the potential for school library culture to influence the school community. The writerâ€™s professional roles and research experiences provoked questions about school libraries as learning spaces.
