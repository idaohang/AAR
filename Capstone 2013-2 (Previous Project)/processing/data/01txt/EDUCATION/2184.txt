This paper addresses challenges in the design of a learning environment for more active and collaborative learning in a QUT Education Masters degree unit delivered in intensive &quot;block&quot; mode. The unit is designed to train future counsellors in assessing children with learning and/or behavioural problems. Previous feedback had highlighted student feelings of isolation and lack of deep learning in completing individual assignments throughout semester after &quot;block&quot;. An educational intervention was designed to engage students in deep learning throughout the whole of semester and to build an online learning community. Using the CASE model (Collaborative, Authentic, Active Assessment for School Counsellors Engaging in Evaluation), an authentic assessment task aimed at enhancing the students' learning and collaboration was designed using OLT. Online assessment tasks were created using video, discussion lists and chat rooms. A pre-post evaluative design was used to measure student attitudes to online learning and their perceptions of collaboration.
