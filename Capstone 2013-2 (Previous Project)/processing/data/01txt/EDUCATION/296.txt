This paper presents some of the findings from a study that explored parental usage and perceptions of a range of early childhood services that were provided in an inner city suburb of Brisbane. Using the theoretical base of social capital, parents (n = 167) from six services were surveyed to elicit information about access to, and use and expectations of, a range of services for families and young children, as well as possible approaches to linking these services. Analysis of data revealed consistency across the different groups of parents in terms of what they looked for in care and education services and widespread agreement that stronger linkages between services would enhance support to families and young children. There were also numerous suggestions as to how service integration could be realised.
