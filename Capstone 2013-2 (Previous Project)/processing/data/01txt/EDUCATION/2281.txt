This paper uses Bernsteinâ€™s theory of pedagogic discourse to examine interview accounts of educational disadvantage provided by Samoan community members engaged as paraprofessionals in secondary schools in the Australian state of Queensland.  While the interview participants were asked a range of questions for an Australian Research Council funded project on the construction of Australian identities through language and literacy practices, the data extracted in this paper focuses only on those accounts that referred explicitly to pedagogic discourses and practices.  In these accounts the Samoan paraprofessionals attributed educational disadvantage to: (a) the arbitrary organisation of students, knowledge and spaces in schooling institutions, and (b) differences between school and Samoan institutions.  The principles of power and control generating the unequal selection, organisation and distribution of school knowledge are discussed in the light of empirical research utilising Bernsteinâ€™s theoretical work on the social re/production of disadvantage in and through schooling discourses and practices.
