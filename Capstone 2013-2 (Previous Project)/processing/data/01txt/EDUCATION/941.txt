SYSTEMS 1 is a screen of general cognitive functioning, for school age children that entails cognitive manipulation and information skills. Our aim was to extend the test for four and five year old children at pre-school, to estimate theoretical starting points in typical cognitive profiles, that are critical in the early years. Participants (N = 1164, girls/boys, 50%) were four to 11 years old (mean 7.9, sd 2.2) at pre-schools and schools in diverse socio-economic areas of Sydney.  Childrenâ€™s responses created the normative database, and the parameters were derived from curve estimation and regression procedures. Results suggest that cognitive screening is reliable and valid for younger and older children, and show a non-linear relation of children's test scores with age, that is characteristic of rapid change for younger children.  The characteristic curve with the best fit to the data had a theoretical starting point before school age, at around 3 years of age. Findings are discussed in light of alternative models, and the clinical and educational applications.
