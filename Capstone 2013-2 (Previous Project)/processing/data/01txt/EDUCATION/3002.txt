This is the third chapter on &quot;sociocultural perspectives&quot; to appear in MERGA reviews  of trends in mathematics education in Australasia. The first chapter (Atweh, Cooper, &amp;  Kanes, 1992) considered research reported in the period 1988-1991 while the second  chapter (Zevenbergen, Atweh, Kanes, &amp; Cooper, 1996) considered research in the period  1992-1995. This chapter considers research trends in the period 2000-2003. It discusses research under three headings. Like the previous reviews, factors associated with disadvantage such as ethnicity and socioeconomic background are discussed in the first section. Factors associated with the teacher are also discussed here in the second section of the chapter. However, this discussion is limited to teachersâ€™ professionalisation and socialisation. Included in this is the area of research on  teachersâ€™ values because it is an emerging area on the international scene with a significant contribution from Australasian researchers. Finally, like the previous reviews, new theoretical perspectives used by mathematics educators are reviewed in the third section of this chapter. In addition emerging interests in mathematics education in global context are also discussed.
