While debates in the literature continue on the pedagogical validity of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) it is generally agreed that it is not enough to simply transfer classroom content to an online environment and expect equivalent learning outcomes.  This paper explores the pedagogical and technical issues, challenges and outcomes of creating an online information literacy course from an on-campus course.  In particular, the key aspects which the teaching librarians considered as they undertook the challenge of providing sound educational practices in the online environment.  AIRS Online is offered as a parallel study option to Advanced Information Retrieval Skills (IFN001: AIRS) for QUT postgraduate students, a compulsory face-to-face course for all QUT doctoral students. The aim of this project was to optimise studentsâ€™ access to IFN001: AIRS and meet the Universityâ€™s objectives regarding flexible delivery and online teaching. AIRS Online extends beyond the current notion of static online information literacy tutorials by providing a facilitator-driven, student focussed learning environment comprising content and learning experiences enhanced by appropriate multimedia technology and resources which engage students in planned facilitated and/or self-paced learning events. The online content is reinforced with short succinct student-driven learning objects. Course assessment is formative and summative, and is comprised of a research log and reflective journal to provide a means for reviewing the content and key process of advanced information searching and retrieval.
