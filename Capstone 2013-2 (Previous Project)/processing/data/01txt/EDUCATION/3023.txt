This paper will report on the implementation of an open source content management system and communication tools to support an online community of teachers and pre-service teachers at both national and international levels.  The content management system has become an essential part of a thriving community of online learners known as oz-teachernet.  The implementation of this content management system and use of these communication tools has as its main focus, the notion of online virtual communities and further supports the work of undergraduate education students in their information and communication technologies electives.  The elective &quot;Networked Communities&quot; in particular allows a student to explore current trends and practices with communication tools through the use of the open source software.  During this course students use a combination of these available tools to implement a new or modified online learning environment while undertaking professional experience in a school of their choice.  The paper further describes the studentsâ€™ experiences throughout the course and presents recommendations, for educators wishing to espouse a sense of community within online learning environments and pre-service education courses.
