This paper examines how sophisticated picture book resources and process drama strategies enable early years students to demonstrate their learning outcomes within the Critical Strand of the Queensland English Syllabus: Open Trial (QSA, 2005). In the introductory section, sophisticated picture book resources and process drama strategies are defined and their strengths as resources and strategies in early years classrooms are highlighted. The paper then overviews the three strands and each of their three substrands of the Queensland English Syllabus: Open Trial (QSA, 2005) document. In addition, specific Foundation level and Levels One and Two core learning outcomes from the Critical Strand are identified. Finally, a range of process drama activities, based on the popular Anthony Browne (1996) text â€˜Piggybookâ€™, are outlined, and their articulation with specific core learning outcomes are made known.
