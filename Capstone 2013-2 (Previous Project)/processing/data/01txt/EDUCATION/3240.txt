Deborah Henderson attended the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS) on the Hill event as one of two NTEU Representatives. The NTEU has consistently supported the Council for the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (CHASS) as a peak body representing this sector, and the participation of the National Policy and Research Unit Coordinator, Andrew Nette, in a panel on the Briefing Day provided more of a public face to this support. Deborahâ€™s report provides an overview of this recent event and commences with an account of how CHASS was formed and why this lobby group is so significant for the state of the Australian humanities. For as one prominent Australian academic, Simon During (2005), noted there has been much concern that the humanities are able to defend themselves against government policies that prioritise science and technology.
