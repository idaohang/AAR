The use of streaming media is becoming more prominent in the higher education sector as a tool for implementing learning and teaching strategies. Learning activities with high degrees of interactivity and engagement are suggested to be more effective in fostering higher order thinking and learning (Oliver &amp; Omari 1999). To assist teaching staff in developing highly engaging and interactive learning activities Software, Multimedia and Internet Learning Environments (SMILE) developed an Integrated Media Enriched Teaching tool, IMET. The tool was designed to cater to the range of diverse teaching and learning philosophies that underpin learning activities. The intended versatility, personalisation and community participation are evidenced by the diverse range of trial participantsâ€™ use of the tool. The IMET resource facilitated the use of a broad number of Internet learning activities, including concept checking, multiple-choice quizzes, reflection, communication and collaboration, exam revision, pre-testing prior to practical activities (lab and fieldwork), and provision of case studies. This paper examines the use of IMET through several case studies outlining the implications of integrating various media items; if juxtaposing media with cognitive tools media it can facilitate increased interactivity, engagement and ownership among student cohorts.
