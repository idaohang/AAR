This paper investigates issues surrounding the inclusion of students with Asperger's Syndrome in primary school classrooms by first identifying the unique needs of these students, and secondly, by examining some strategies which can facilitate the inclusion of these students into inclusive school settings. These effective methods take into account physical factors within the classroom, the predictability of instructional routines, and building on students' pre-existing knowledge in order to enhance their productivity. The approaches to instruction discussed in this paper are particularly valuable because they are appropriate to the needs of many students in the regular classroom.
