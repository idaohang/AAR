This paper provides a comparative analysis of the ways in which the womenâ€™s movement was able to effect change in educational policy and practice in Australia and Canada between 1970 and 2000, drawing on interviews and document analysis in both countries.  While the movement in both countries drew on similar international texts and conversations, it had more sustained state support in education in Australia.  Despite the different degrees of institutionalisation, similar trends emerged in both countries.  There was more public visibility for the movement in the 1970s and 80s than in the 90s, and a shift in discourse from â€˜womenâ€™s liberationâ€™ and â€˜sexismâ€™ to boys and social justice.  We argue that the movement continues to be a creative source of ideas and change even when it is less visible and less formally represented, and that differences in outcomes are not easily linked to differences in institutionalisation.  In both countries, major change has occurred, although the demands of the movement have not been realised.
