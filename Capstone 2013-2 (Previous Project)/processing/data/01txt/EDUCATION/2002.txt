A model for information system development is proposed. It endeavours to cater for the diverse needs of schools more effectively.  It involves the integration of Information Needs Analysis, Human Computer Interaction and Information System Evaluation, with the individual user as a central focus. An implementation of a prototype, dataCupboard is described. It provides a shell-like interface to existing educational management systems.
