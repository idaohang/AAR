The field of ethics has attracted increasing interest in educational contexts in recent times and one reason for this heightened interest is the more complex operational milieu (Grace in Campbell 1997, p.223) in which leaders are now working.  In the current climate, it is likely that educational leaders could find themselves confronted with ethical dilemmas which require a choice among competing sets of principles, values, beliefs and perspectives. This paper reports on a model for conceptualising ethical dilemmas. To illustrate the application of the model in practice, we provide a scenario and a commentary based on that scenario using the model for analysis.
