This paper reports on a study of Year 3 children's addition and subtraction mental computation abilities, and the complexity of interaction of cognitive and affective factors that support and diminish their ability to compute proficiently (accurately and flexibly).  In particular, the study investigated the part played by number sense knowledge (e.g., numeration, number facts, estimation and effects of operations on number), metacognition, memory and affects (e.g., beliefs, attitudes).  It found that proficient mental addition and subtraction was a consequence of the integration of all factors, but that accurate mental addition and subtraction could occur when some factors were impoverished if there was compensation.
