The challenge for universities is not one of keeping pace with 'new technologies' as they are often at the forefront of such developments. In contrast, the challenge is connected to pedagogy, and in particular, how the Academy collectively comes to understand the framework of what it is to be an educated person in the 21st Century. In short, this issue revolves around the question of 'how should individuals be equipped for knowledge age work?' Such work is epitomised by notions of virtual teams where innovative, collaborative team members located in differing global time zones, use synchronous and asynchronous groupware technologies to pass the 'baton of conversation' from one to anotherâ€”a &quot;hybrid that is both talking and writing yet isnâ€™t completely either&quot; (Coate, 1997, p. 165). As the notion of the knowledge worker/learner takes hold in universities, assessment tasks within the institution are invariably moving from traditional print and face-to-face modes to those of a digital nature. This chapter argues that a corresponding digital realignment of assessment must extend to our thinking about both the assessment process and product.
