For many students the study of Science can be very disaffirming. This may lead to passivity in class, and a lifelong disaffection with science, outcomes which defeat the long-term purposes of trying to achieve scientific literacy for all students. This article represents a new way of framing scientific literacy with a &quot;science for all&quot; goal, based on a nexus of psychological, sociological and critical literacy theory. A science education researcher and a science teacher collaborated in trialing the use of affirmational dialogue journal writing with early adolescents in a high school situated in a low socio economic status area. The intervention was found to be successful on a number of fronts. I conclude that an approach which affirms students' experience can lead to a deeper approach to learning for adolescent science students. Â©1999 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.
