This paper discusses the introduction of an online integrated learning environment (ILE) in two primary schools.  The project (currently ongoing) aims to work collaboratively with teachers for three years to explore and establish the potential use of information technology (IT) in primary school classrooms.  It aims to assist teachers in developing alternative teaching and learning strategies involving use of IT for coping with individual learning differences.  The paper provides the rationale and reports on progress of the project to date.  In the past twelve months practical help has been given to teachers and students to assist them in the use of appropriate IT resources and tools in the classroom. Through the use of an individual study plan, classroom learning and teaching activities have been carefully designed and constructed to provide settings with opportunities for students to take control of their own learning and monitor their own progress.  The individualized study plans are designed according to student ability grouping.  Through the personal profiling system (PPS), parents, teachers and students can regularly monitor progress. Detailed diagnostic data from the PPS allow teachers to closely monitor and evaluate the impact on student learning.
