From a very young age Aaron has displayed exceptional ability and interest in board games, reading and mathematics, and a concern for social justice.  He was noted for his ability to read house plans and use street directories and maps to guide drivers to their destinations.  His drawings are exceptionally detailed and display a strong sense of spatial awareness and geometry.  However, although Aaron becomes absorbed in science and mathematical activities he is frustrated with normal classroom tasks which he often leaves unfinished preferring to focus on real world problems and issues.  Indeed, in the classroom he is often difficult to manage and is at risk of becoming an underachiever.  His behaviours are reminiscent of those displayed by non-conforming gifted children, including Einstein, Newton, Pascal and Russell all of whom had difficult experiences in formal education.  The challenge facing teachers and parents is to recognise and cater for children like Aaron to ensure that their unusual talents are realised.
