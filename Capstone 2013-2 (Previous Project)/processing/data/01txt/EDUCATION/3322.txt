This newspaper article in the Perspective section of the Courier Mail defends the introduction of the Key Learning Area (KLA) of Studies of Sociery and Environment (SOSE) in the midst of the debates about its worth by referring to the significance of history and geography in the curriculum; the need for rigor in learning and the value of critical thinking in terms of intellectual skills and as a life skill. Finally it explores the broader debate about what education is for. The article defends SOSE against the unfounded neo-conservative critiques.
