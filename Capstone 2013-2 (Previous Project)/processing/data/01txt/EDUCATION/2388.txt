International student numbers studying within the Faculty of Business at Queensland University of Technology now make up more that 20% of total student numbers and come from increasingly diverse parts of the world.  Through strategic action by the university this diversity will increase.    This study identifies the differing expectations of students from different geographical regions, and how reality met these expectations.  The data was collected through a series of informal groups where students from particular regions were encouraged to discuss their expectations and the nature of the reality of their study.  It cannot be assumed that students coming from very different cultural backgrounds and geographical locations have the same expectations of the educational experience they will be receive, or respond in the same way to the processes they encounter.  The study also contributes to the development of a model for providing an effective learning experience for international students.
