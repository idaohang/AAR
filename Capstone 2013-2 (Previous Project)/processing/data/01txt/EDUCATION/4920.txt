Traditionally, mathematics has received little attention in prior-to-school settings, however, extensive research in the last 30 years has recognised that mathematical learning is critical to success and achievement in both school and life pursuits. Research has also documented childrenâ€™s capabilities for complex mathematical thinking and reasoning, and recently curriculum has been developed that addresses young childrenâ€™s competencies and potentials. This paper reviews current literature to provide a justification for the inclusion of mathematical modelling activities in preparatory settings. Mathematical modelling activities move beyond traditional problem solving to encourage children to develop and explore significant, real world mathematical ideas.
