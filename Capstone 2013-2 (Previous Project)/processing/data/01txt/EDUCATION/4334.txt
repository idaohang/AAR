This paper explores a whole school approach to the prevention and intervention for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychopathology in childhood and adolescence. In addition to having serious consequences for academic, social and family life, anxiety has also been shown to be a precursor to depression, substance abuse and eating disorders. School counsellors are well placed to identify students with anxiety disorders, instigate prevention programs and treat or refer anxious students. Prevention and early intervention for anxiety disorders needs to be co-ordinated and integrated into the regular curriculum as well as into the life of the classroom and the school. Barriers to schools working well in this area are identified and discussed.
