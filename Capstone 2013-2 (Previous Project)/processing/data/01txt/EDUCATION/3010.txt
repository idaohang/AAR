The Student Action Research for University Access (SARUA) is a participatory action  research project between groups of senior high school students, their schoolteachers and  university staff. During the eight years of its activities in at least 17 high schools in the greater  metropolitan area of Brisbane significant learnings have developed about working with  students on projects that affect their own lives. This paper problematises aspects of  partnerships and collaboration between two diverse cultures of the university and the school  and discusses the benefits of such collaboration, some of the challenges faced and the  responsibilities of the university partners in facilitating action research with young people.
