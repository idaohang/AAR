For many years researchers and practitioners in education settings have attempted through processes of educational reform and inclusive school development to break down the industrial age assumptions about schools, learning, and teacher-student relationships. This project involved Australian secondary school students working as participatory researchers in collaboration with a researcher, teachers and parents. Research methodology using visual narrative techniques provided the students with a conceptual lens to view their school community: The examples of visual narrative shared in this presentation, depict problems, contradictions of exclusion and celebrations of inclusion in the lived world of the students. Photographs combined with stories represent studentsâ€™ views of their social, cultural and political environment. This project illustrates how the insights of students can help break down assumptions, values and meanings that block progress to achieving more socially just schools.
