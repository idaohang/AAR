This paper addresses one approach to reconciling theory, research, and practice,namely, a multitiered teaching experiment involving a models and modelling approachto learning. The four-tiered teaching experiment explored in this paper involves participants at different levels of development who work interdependently towards the common goal of finding meaning in, and learning from, their respective experiences. The research examined here is concerned with the design and implementation of experiences that maximise learning at each level. These experiences involve the construction and application of models, which are used to describe, make sense of, explain, or predict the behaviour of some complex system. Two classroom studies are presented to illustrate how a theory of models and modelling can guide the development and implementation of a multitiered teaching experiment. A focus on the teachersâ€™ construction of models of teaching and learning is presented to illustrate how theory and research can assist the practice of classroom teachers.
