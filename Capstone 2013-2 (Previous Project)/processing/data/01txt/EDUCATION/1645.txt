Mathematical learning in gifted children depends on the nature of the mathematical task and the implementation of effective teaching strategies.  In this paper, we argue the importance of increasing the complexity of regular classroom mathematical tasks to provide gifted children with opportunities to experience greater challenge.  The approach is illustrated by the experience of a young gifted girl who finds no challenge in solving a regular problem but with teacher support can be challenged by the same task made more complex.  The advantages of this approach are argued in terms of enhanced interest, motivation, metacognition and the development of autonomy.  The role of the teacher as a scaffolder and model is crucial to this process.
