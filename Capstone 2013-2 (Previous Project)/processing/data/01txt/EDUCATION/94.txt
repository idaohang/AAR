A survey was undertaken of graduates from various library courses at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane. The instrument was developed in consultation with schools offering similar courses nationally, so that it could subsequently be used for national comparison. The survey was structured to take account of knowledge, skills, and competencies explicated in Australian documents that provide competency guidance in library and information management areas. It was also designed to enable comparison with a previously published survey analysis. The survey identifies 189 skills grouped into nine categories: collection building and management; communication; facilities and equipment; information organisation; information services; information systems; management; marketing; and research. The response rate to the survey was low, but nevertheless provided a useful comparison between the expectations of graduates working in different sectors, for different time periods. Findings for respondents as a group show that each of the top five ranked skills were in the information services category, as were seven of the top ten ranked skills. There were marked differences between the rankings assigned by this group and those of a similar North American study. Tables showing the ranking of skills expectations are provided. Comments are made about curriculum developments that are influenced by these data.
