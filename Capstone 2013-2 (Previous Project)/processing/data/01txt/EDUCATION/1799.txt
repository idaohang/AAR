Many teacher education courses carry out only minimally their rhetorical goals of preparing teachers to practise intercultural education. The traditional approach prepares teachers for cultural assimilation, immersing them in the ethnocentric assumptions of one culture, and marginalising studies of cultural diversity.   This article argues that preparing teachers for cultural diversity is a centrally important goal of teacher education, given the context of the harrowing ethnic conflicts and the changing ethnoscapes of our globalizing era. Exploring the continuum of ethnic discourses which may inform teacher education, ranging from ethnocentrism to critical interculturalism, is necessary in order to evaluate the stage of development of the programme. The article comments on strategies in the USA and Australia that could improve multicultural content and pedagogy in the teacher education degree, as well as in the partnerships between the teacher education course and the various organizational stakeholders.
