This paper considers the efficacy of integrating picture books resources &amp; process drama activities to enhance middle years students' engagement with multimodal text. While picture books &amp; role play have not traditionally been seen as sophisticated resources &amp; strategies for young adolescents, this paper suggests that they have much utility for engaging middle years students as code breakers, text participants, text users &amp; text analysts (Luke &amp; Freebody, 2000) of written, visual, oral &amp; gestural texts. This paper involves readers in exploring the sophistication of picture book resources for young adolescents &amp; working through a range of process drama activities. The workshop activities are based on the John Marsden &amp; Shaun Tan (2003) allegory of colonisation, 'The Rabbits'.  Specifically, 'attribute lists', 'sculptures', 'transformations', 'freeze frames' &amp; 'conscious alley' activities will be introduced &amp; analysed in terms of the literacy practice demands they make of middle years students.
