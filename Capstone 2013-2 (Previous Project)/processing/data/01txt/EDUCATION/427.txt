This paper presents an account of a developing project designed to enhance the language proficiency and cultural awareness of students of both Indonesian and English through inclusion in their language program of computer-mediated exchanges. The use of computer-mediated communication means the focus is particularly on reading and writing although the texts created also serve as a basis for in-class discussion as teachers and students work to interpret the intention of their interlocutors.
