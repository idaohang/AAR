The first year experience (FYE) is both exciting and daunting for university students.  Ensuring that this experience is positive and enjoyable is increasingly important for  universities, with research indicating that studentsâ€™ initial experiences will determine  whether they complete their degree (McInnes, James and Hartley 2000).  This paper analyses student responses to one open-ended question in a survey that  considered studentsâ€™ initial experiences of university at the Carseldine and Caboolture  Campuses of Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in 2005. The question was  How could QUT and the campus improve your experience as a first-year student?  Please describe both positive and negative aspects of your experience. The responses  were classified into five categories: Enrolment/Orientation Issues, Socio-cultural  Issues, Academic Support, Access to Information and General Comments.  Some students did not comment (n=109) but those that did respond (n=155) identified  some key challenges and possible solutions. These included: the provision of social  activities for first year students, the need for improved clarity in enrolment processes,  and more information and pre-commencement sessions on course  structures/requirements/choices and career pathways.  Two major implications for the initial phases of first year can be discerned from the  challenges identified by the students. Firstly, improvements are required in  orientation/induction programs and, secondly, the information provided to students, as  well as the means for accessing that information, need to be clear and consistent.
