This paper addresses 7th-grade children's mathematical modelling at the end of a 3-year program. The children and their teachers participated in a series of mathematical modelling activities from the 5th grade through to the 7th grade. The problems involve authentic situations that need to be interpreted and described in mathematical ways.  We examine the mathematical understandings and mathematisation processes that the children used in constructing their models for the final problem (Summer Reading). We report on the nature of the problem factors that the children chose to consider, the operations they applied, the types of transformations they made through these operations, and the representations they used in documenting their models.
