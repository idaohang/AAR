This study investigated the teaching and learning expectations of undergraduate students in a teacher training Educational Psychology course. Whether students prefer a social-constructivist approach to teaching in their tutorial classes was explored. The mode of teaching that students prefer and the role of the tutor were considered. Results obtained through a qualitative questionnaire administered to 81 undergraduate students showed that students expect to learn about how to apply psychological theory to their own teaching, which is contrary to currently held beliefs about what students expect (Woolfolk Hoy, 1996). The study also found that students prefer to work within a constructivist framework where the tutor is a facilitator.
