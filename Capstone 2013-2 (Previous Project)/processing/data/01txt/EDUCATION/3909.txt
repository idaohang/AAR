While information and communication technology (ICT) offers new and innovative modes of learning, educators need to analyze the various issues of enhancing a sound integration of ICT tools in schools. This author reports in the paper some preliminary findings about the implementation of a project for fostering an ICT-based integrated learning environment in Hong Kong schools, of which include, first, any effective integration of ICT calls for substantial thinking and rethinking of curricular and educational practice, and inevitably time and effort must be expended when developing in teachers a critical understanding of ICT as a shaper of information and values. Second, the use of ICT must provide students with a variety of experiences and contexts to integrate their skills and knowledge both in and out of school. Third, true cross-curricular integration can take place only when teachers appreciate the rich potential of ICT for enabling more effective learning where ICT is subordinated to the learning goals of the school. And fourth, teachers would critically select the appropriate digital content based on the needs and learning styles of their students and infuse it into the curriculum.
