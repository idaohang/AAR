This paper reports on a teaching experiment, conducted in 2003, which aimed at enhancing young studentsâ€™ mental computation performance through incorporating research (the researcherâ€™s own and that of others) into classroom practice.  Research findings on studentsâ€™ mental computation performance were presented to two Year 3 teachers, along with practical ideas (web sites, readings, etc.) to form a foundation for a short instructional program.  The researcher supported the teachers in developing the program, and the teachers took responsibility for implementing the program.  This program was developed by the teachers and the researcher.  Pre- and post-instruction individual interviews were conducted to monitor student progress and inform the instructional program.
