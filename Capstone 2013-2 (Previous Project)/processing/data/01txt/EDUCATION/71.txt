Some proponents of online teaching seem captivated by new digital technologies, network-based services and media-rich resources. But yielding to technocentric imperatives is usually a poor start to curriculum design in higher education. In this presentation we sketch out how we designed and orchestrated a large subject where various forms of online (and decidedly off-line) technologies were garnered for clear pedagogical purposes. Based on feedback from students and teaching staff we reflect on the deep structural elements of the unit, including: the structured lecture series that introduced dilemmas, analysed the issues theoretically, and then sought case study embodiment of good practice; an inquiry-based collaborative assignment (webquest) that introduced students to critical and reflective academic-like writing; and cornerstone videos: a series of interviews with practitioners in the field that lead to extended conversations about practical issues.
