Specific reading disability is difficult to diagnose when it is an isolated problem, but becomes even more difficult if it is masked or complicated by other factors such as ADHD or, in this case, ESL.  Specific reading disability is just as prevalent in non-English speaking populations as it is in English only populations (Wade-Woolley &amp; Siegel, 1997).  It is therefore just as likely for a child who is an ESL speaker to have a specific reading disability and it is imperative that this is considered when ESL children show signs of reading difficulty.  This paper provides an example of just such a child.  The process of diagnosis and successful intervention is reported.
