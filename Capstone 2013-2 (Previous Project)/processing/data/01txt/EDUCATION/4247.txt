This paper addresses the nature of child-initiated episodes of mathematical patterning prior to formal schooling. In a multi-site case study, childrenâ€™s engagement in mathematical patterning experiences was investigated as was the teachersâ€™ involvement and influence in these experiences. A conceptual framework was used to guide the examination of how children generate, engage in, and direct mathematical patterning activity. The analysis of two child-initiated patterning episodes revealed that they provide rich learning opportunities for both the children who initiate the episodes and their peers who share the episodes. The results also highlight the important role of the teacher in fostering childrenâ€™s patterning development.
