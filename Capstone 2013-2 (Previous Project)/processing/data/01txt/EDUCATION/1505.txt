Engaging children in mathematical investigations is advocated as a means of facilitating mathematical learning.  However there is limited guidance for teachers on ways to support young children engaged in investigations.  This study provides insights into the mathematical literacy required by seven-to-eight-year-old students undertaking investigations.  Examples of difficulties are described in relation to problem solving, representation, manipulation, and reasoning.  While mathematical investigations can enhance young childrenâ€™s learning, teachers need to provide guidance to address necessary skills and knowledge.
