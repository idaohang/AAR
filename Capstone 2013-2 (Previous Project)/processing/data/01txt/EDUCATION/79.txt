The growth in the use of e-portfolios across all sectors of education in recent years has been dramatic (Truer &amp; Jensen, 2003; Barrett, 2001). For some this is a case of technology catching up with existing teaching pedagogy, for others a new electronic tool that offers the possibility of incorporating; electronic artefacts, the World Wide Web and databases for storing, sorting and viewing artefacts and experiences (Truer &amp; Jensen, 2003; Barrett, 2001).  This paper will firstly reflect on two QUT e-portfolio tools: the Student Capability Profile (assessment focused) and the Student Portfolio (employment focused). The following discussion will then advance possible new interactive tools incorporating a reflective focus (Schon, 1998; Kerka, 1996; Sher, Williams &amp; Sharkey, 2002), utilising journal tools and a learning focus utilising learning objects and online teaching and learning tools (Robbin, 2001; Hodgins, 2000; Bates, 1995).
