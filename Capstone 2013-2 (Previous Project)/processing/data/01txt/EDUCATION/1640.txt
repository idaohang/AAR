Current research is demonstrating that young children can make significant mathematical and social gains from working authentic modelling problems. This paper argues for the implementation of mathematical modelling activities within the elementary and middle school years. The key features of these activities that make them rich learning experiences for children are explored. Some detailed analyses of how children develop and apply generalizable conceptual systems are then presented. It is argued that analogical and case-based reasoning processes play a powerful role in the construction and application of generalized models.
