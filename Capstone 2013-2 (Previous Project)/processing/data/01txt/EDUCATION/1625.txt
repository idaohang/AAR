This paper will report on the conduct of an undergraduate course where pre-service teachers participate in and develop or modify an online learning environment. The course has as its main focus, the notion of online virtual communities, and explores studentsâ€™ current trends and practices with communication tools and networked communities with those currently being offered in a variety of educational contexts. During the course participants implement their new or modified online learning environment while undertaking professional experience in a school of their choice.  The paper further describes the studentsâ€™ experiences throughout the course and presents recommendations, for educators wishing to espouse a sense of community within online learning environments.
