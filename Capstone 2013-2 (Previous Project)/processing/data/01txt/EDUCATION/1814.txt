The rapidly changing demands made of teachers and the work that they do means that it is becoming important to better understand the work of teachers.  This paper explores how one group of teachers talk about the work that they prepare international students to study in Australia.  Drawing upon interview accounts, these teachers talk about the gap that has to be bridged.  In doing so, the teachers suggest a range of strategies that they implement.  Bernsteinâ€™s concepts of classification and framing and visible and invisible pedagogy are used alongside Bourdieu and Passeronâ€™s notion of primary and secondary pedagogic work to theorise these teachersâ€™ understanding of their cross-cultural work.
