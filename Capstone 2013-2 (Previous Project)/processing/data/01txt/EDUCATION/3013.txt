The provision of a range of online learning resources will minimise treating on-campus and distance-education students differently. Learning resources provided in a CD ROM could enhance the learning experiences of both on-campus and distance-education students. Supplementary resource materials provided to on-campus students can offer opportunities to enhance and broaden the learning experiences of distance-education students. Hence, both essential and supplementary learning resources should be made available to all students. Web-based learning and teaching approaches can increase and promote more active student engagement and interaction. It can provide easier or more equitable access by students to learning materials. Well-designed, interactive, up-to-date, fast to download, easy to read, easy to navigate, and good visual design are important parameters which can determine the effectiveness of CD-ROM for student learning.
