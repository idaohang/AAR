The phasing out of print based materials for external students in the Faculty of Education at QUT has led to a greater reliance on online teaching and learning. Both staff and students in the School of Early Childhood were surveyed to identify the features of online delivery that were positive contributors to the quality of teaching and learning as well as those features that might present difficulties or barriers to the  quality of teaching and learning. As a whole, results indicated that both students and staff were positive about online delivery, and suggested that it is a contributing factor to the quality of teaching and learning. This paper reports on the results of the student surveys and raises questions around different ways of conceptualising effective online learning environments and practices in higher education environments.
