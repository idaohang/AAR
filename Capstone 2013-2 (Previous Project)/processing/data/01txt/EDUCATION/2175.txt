Approaches to teaching reading to children who have literacy difficulties have often been summarised as a choice between either a whole language or a decoding approach.  It is maintained in this paper that this either or notion has failed to acknowledge that reading is a dynamic process where the elements of language, thinking (metacognition), and phonological skills form an interactive relationship and any weakness in one of these elements inhibits the childâ€™s reading development.  This position paper explores the three elements, the implications for classroom practice when the focus is on a combination of the three elements, and outlines possible direction for future research.
