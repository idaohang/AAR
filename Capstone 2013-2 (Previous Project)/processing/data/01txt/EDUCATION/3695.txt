This paper seeks to present the merits of numerous studies by conducting a review of literature available online. It discusses some of the means of effectively evaluating, designing and managing e-Learning programmes and hopes to accurately envisage what the future may hold for the development of online education. Despite the ample support and enthusiasm for virtual models of learning from both the corporate and educational arenas, the effectiveness of e-Learning is by no means a sure thing. Successful e-Learning programmes require specific conditions and constant monitoring and a lot more research has yet to be done before an acceptable universal model can be developed.
