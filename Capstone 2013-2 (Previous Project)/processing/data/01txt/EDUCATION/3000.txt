This paper summarizes initial data from a study that investigates issues in  internationalization and globalization of mathematics education in two regions:  Australasia and Latin America. The first stage of study employed the methodology of  focus groups with mathematics educators from Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and  Colombia. The paper presents an initial theoretical model to investigate  internationalization and globalization in the field, presents the methodology  employed and discusses the alternative conceptualizations exhibited by the  participants, some of the reasons they identified for them and some of the problems  they identified.
