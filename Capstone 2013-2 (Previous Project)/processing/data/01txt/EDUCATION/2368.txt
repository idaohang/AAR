Large amounts of user and systems information is tracked by Learning Management Systems (LMS), affording the evaluation of online learning and teaching behaviour from a teaching unit level through to an enterprise level. At Queensland University of Technology, data from the in-house built LMS was mined over the period 2001- present for trends and usage information in order to provide a valuable perspective to evaluating systems usage, learning and teaching behaviours and benchmarking. This case study investigates the role of quantitative data in evaluating teaching and learning at various levels from unit of study to the enterprise through the establishment of benchmarks. Analysis of asynchronous discussion forum usage is discussed as an example.
