This paper reviews Basil Bernsteinâ€™s (1996) book Pedagogy, symbolic control and identity, focussing specifically on the usefulness of Bernsteinâ€™s concepts for an analysis of curricular justice in schooling.  The review details five concepts from Bernsteinâ€™s model and demonstrates the relevance of these to analyses of equity policies and curricular justice in Queensland schools. These five concepts include: (1) classification and framing; (2) instructional and regulative discourse; (3) recontextualisation; (4) micro-politics of curricular justice and (5) pedagogic models. The paper also links theory to empirical data demonstrating how the Bernsteinian theoretical corpus is illustrative of adaptive theory â€“ simultaneously cumulative and evolving, macro and micro, deductive and inductive.
