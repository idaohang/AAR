This paper comes from a larger study that seeks to develop understandings about the knowledge bases of eductors working in offshore contexts.  In particular it focuses on interview accounts from teachers employed in Australian-owned institutions in Central Java, Indonesia.  This paper highlights emerging tensions in these accounts as the teachers encounter multiple and sometimes conflicting expectations of the knowledge bases required of teachers in offshore instruction.   Specifically the paper utilises Bernsteinâ€™s concept of pedagogic identities and his concept of classification alongside Bourdieuâ€™s notion of habitus to theorise the construction of the multiple knowledge bases teachers require for a particular offshore education context.
