Community leaders are often unsung heroes who work tirelessly for and with others in order to make a difference in their communities. In many cases, they take on leadership roles and responsibilities not because they are paid to do so, but because they have the motivation and commitment to address a perceived need for change and or practical improvement in some aspect of community life. This paper reports on an initiative that was established to support the learning and professional growth of community leaders in Queensland, Australia. The initiative is a specially designed website which provides a range of learning activities for community leaders including a problem based learning activity, cases studies of community leaders, and a range of articles and resources that illuminate issues and information deemed significant for leaders in the community.  The website was developed in partnership between a university and a volunteering peak body organisation and made possible through a university community service grant.   The intention of this paper is to give the reader insight into the processes that underpinned the development of the initiative and recount the issues and challenges that can emerge from partnership projects.
