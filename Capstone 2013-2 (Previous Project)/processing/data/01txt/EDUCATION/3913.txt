Integration of IT across the curriculum of teacher education programmes, though in a relatively early stage in Hong Kong, has been a top agenda item for action at the Hong Kong Institute of Education over the last few years.  Acknowledging the importance of preparing IT competent students, the Institute has committed resources for the immediate integration of IT across its programmes. In 2000 an IT Competency in Education policy was adopted to ensure that students would be adequately prepared to become competent users of IT as productivity tools, and act as facilitators of learning in order to enhance the learning of their students.    This paper details the progress of the IT integration work at the Institute from the beginning. It blends research findings generated in other countries to shed light on the formulation and implementation of the policy for IT competency in education and takes stock of some of the issues that have arisen within a very short period of sixteen months.    Information contained in this paper provides a basis for discussion by those who are currently involved in designing programmes for preservice students and may well serve as a case study that can be used to guide the design of future programmes. It also recognizes that such developments need to be continually refined and developed if teachers are to be fully prepared to use IT meaningfully in their professional practice.
