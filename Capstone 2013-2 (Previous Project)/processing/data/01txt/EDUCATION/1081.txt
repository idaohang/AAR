There is substantial  literature on new work practices and the associated skills required of  workers in the 'new capitalism' but very few consider workersâ€™ perspectives on the advocacies. The study reported here involved 39 participants aged 40 plus who were interviewed to obtain data in relation to their conceptions of work and learning at work. This was conducted with consideration given to the changing work practices occurring around them. The participants were from a medical service and an engineering organization. The data were analyzed qualitatively and results indicated four and five hierarchical conceptions of work, and learning at work, respectively. It became apparent that a significantly large number of older workers conceived of work and learning at work in quantitative terms and as separate entities. The data were further analysed to ascertain how the conceptions mapped with the participantsâ€™ AQF levels. This analysis indicated some dissonance between AQF levels and conceptions. The findings of this study provide baseline data to understand older workersâ€™ behaviours in light of the current changes in work practices.
