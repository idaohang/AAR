A recent small scale study was conducted in Queensland on behalf of a state professional association to inform its position statement on the professional development of teachers in ICT (ICT PD). Data for the study was drawn from a survey of teachers at the association's 2004 state conference and semi-structured interviews with leaders from a cross-section of educational systems.     The study was premised on an understanding of professional development as the interrelationship and reflexivity of theory and practice. It identified the models of ICT PD as being tertiary study, school-based programs, single events, online curriculum projects, serial courses in hybrid or face-to-face mode, professional communities, and action learning/research. As a measure of effectiveness, the impacts were identified as being direct and/or sustained impact on practice, personal knowledge, increased ICT skills, reflection on practice, professional status, professional networks, and peer collaboration.    The study concluded that the characteristics of ICT PD were (1) Context, in terms of relevance and immediacy; (2) Time, as both a measure and a variable of need (timeliness); (3) Community, referring to professional collaborations; and (4) Personal Growth, both cognitive challenges and &quot;corporate&quot; knowledge. The study concluded that these characteristics are dynamic and interdependent and need to be considered in the design of effective ICT PD for teachers.
