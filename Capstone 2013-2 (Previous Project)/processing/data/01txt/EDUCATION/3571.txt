In 2001-2002, an innovative project entitled Reach In-Reach Out was begun in Far North  Queensland. Its aim was to use telecommunications and Internet tools to facilitate  communication between the children of Lockhart River who attend secondary school in such  centres as Cairns, Townsville and Herberton and their families. The study described in this paper is the second (of three) to investigate the impact of this project and in this, is a direct continuation of research begun in 2002. Its focus is on the teachers of the secondary boarding schools and residential colleges attended by the children of Loc khart River and who are directly involved in maintaining the remote links of the project. The study described in this paper adopted an interconnected activity system (Engestrom, 1987) as its framework for analysis. The study was funded through a QUT Faculty of Education grant.
