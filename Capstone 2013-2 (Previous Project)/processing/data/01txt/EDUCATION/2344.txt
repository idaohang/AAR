Research from the Queensland Preparing for School Trials (2003/2004) indicates that children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds progressed less in numeracy measures compared to children from socially advantaged backgrounds, particularly in Year 1 (p. 177). This finding highlights two key questions for early childhood educators. Why are children from disadvantaged groups not making adequate progress in their Mathematics learning? And, how can these children be supported in their Mathematical learning and understanding to ensure their success and progress in the later years of schooling? This presentation puts forward several propositions for why particular groups of children may not be engaging in Mathematics. In particular, it will discuss the literature on the effects of poverty on childrenâ€™s mathematical learning and understanding, the teaching practices utilised in early childhood contexts for developing this understanding, and the language of Mathematics. This discussion will provide a foundation for further discussion of how to enhance Mathematics learning for all groups of children in early childhood contexts.
