The libraries of the University of Melbourne and Queensland University of Technology have two distinctly different approaches to coordinating information literacy. During 1999, each Library reviewed various aspects of their coordination processes, the result of which was the implementation of innovative approaches to managing their education and training programs.    Although the libraries service the needs of parent Universities with distinct educational agendas, they share a common focus concerning Information Literacy objectives and issues. Each library has an extensive teaching and learning tradition and demonstrates a strong commitment to student learning outcomes. Furthermore, as multi-campus institutions, the development, coordination and management of their education and training programs presents similar opportunities and challenges.     However, each Library has adopted distinctly different operational models. This paper presents an overview of the coordination models adopted by each Library and analyses their individual rationales, within the context of their organisations, for applying these models. It summarises the redevelopment and implementation processes undertaken, including operational initiatives, managerial strategies, staffing and resourcing issues and evaluation and feedback methodologies.    This paper analyses the success or otherwise of each model.  It provides a critique of both approaches in terms of achievements, challenges and issues born as a result of each process. It also seeks to identify future trends and improvements to be undertaken in subsequent reviews.
