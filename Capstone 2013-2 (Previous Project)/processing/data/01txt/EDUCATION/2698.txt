This chapter is about the characteristics and needs of gifted children and an approach to teaching which caters for gifted children within the regular classroom.  The approach is supported by a set activities that provide a flexible framework for teaching science and mathematics.  We draw on our experiences of catering for gifted young children through extension programs for which the strategies and activities were developed.  Most of the activities can be implemented with all children, however the gifted perform and benefit especially from these activities if we capitalize on the full opportunities inherent in the tasks.  The activities have also been taken up by many pre-service and practicing teachers whom we have taught or who have attended professional development programs run by us.  We are encouraged that our experiences have value for teaching of science and mathematics in classrooms with heterogeneous groups of children.  Indeed the challenge of catering for the gifted makes us examine our own practices to ensure that the needs of all individuals, including the gifted, are met within the classroom.  Our response, therefore, is to share our ideas with readers enthusiastic to improve the teaching of science and mathematics.
