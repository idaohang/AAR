The purpose of the study was to develop and investigate the effectiveness of a short  instructional program to enhance mental computation strategies (addition and  subtraction) in two classes of Year 3 students (approximately 8 years of age).  Outcomes of the project were aimed at benefiting both the teachers and the  students. The short instructional program made use of two models (100 board and  empty number line) to support studentsâ€™ development of mental strategies. Preinstruction  and post-instruction interviews were conducted to monitor studentsâ€™  progress.
