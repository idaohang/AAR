â€˜Applied Skills and Scholarshipâ€™ (HHB116) is a core unit for first year students, which was historically delivered using the traditional lecture and tutorial format. However, with a sudden increase in student numbers and a demand for more flexibility, it became apparent that a fresh approach was necessary to accommodate student needs.     The solution entailed a mixed delivery approach that integrated the use of educational technology, personal interaction and collaborative exercises. While the content remained unchanged, streamed audio recordings substituted the traditional lecture format. Face-to-face tutorial sessions were retained, and group work activities were introduced. The question now is whether first year students can be responsible for their own learning in such a unit, whether they have the motivation and discipline to manage their study without the closer guidance of traditional delivery. Have we assumed too much?    This paper will explore the use of a â€˜blended environmentâ€™ from a pedagogical perspective, and will investigate the benefits, disadvantages and the resulting modifications that may be necessary to ensure successful learning outcomes for students.
