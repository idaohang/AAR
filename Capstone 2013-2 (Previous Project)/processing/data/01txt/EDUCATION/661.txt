This paper examines Brunerâ€™s notion of scaffolding in one-to-one teaching of Maths Recovery. The interactions of two teachers working with students were videotaped and then transcribed. The sessions are described and discussed. The results of this study showed that scaffolding is an important characteristic deemed to be suitable in one-to-one teaching of Maths Recovery. However, more study of one-to-one teaching is needed to further understand the types of characteristics that would enhance the teaching and learning process in one-to-one teaching.
