There is anecdotal evidence that engineering education has for a long time propagated a narrow technical mindset no longer relevant to a world of community and globalisation or appropriate for achieving sustainable futures.  This teaching team explores ways of improving traditional learning environments.  Lecturers, tutors and students share goals, morals and values, attitudes and behaviours from a local and global perspective.  Students engage with the subject matter by writing personal journals, communication tutorials, computing skills, drawing skills and teamwork.  This approach is an attempt to enrich the curriculum and teaching/learning process by improving student understanding of self and the way others behave and communicate.  This understanding will continue to evolve over time and hopefully permeate all personal and professional decision making which ultimately affects quality of life.  The teaching staff aim to model sustainable personal and professional practice.
