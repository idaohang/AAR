In September 2003, the University Academic Board of the Queensland University of Technology endorsed a new assessment policy. Most significantly, the policy stated that &quot;the fundamental approach to assessment... will be criterion-referencing&quot;. These few words served as a catalyst to review and critique existing assessment practices across the university, while, at the same time, (re)consider current teaching and learning approaches. The year 2004 was deemed one of &quot;consciousness-raising&quot; with the implementation of criterion-referenced assessment expected in strategic first year units. To assist in this process, Teaching and Learning Support Services trialed a range of strategies in response to academics' requests for support. This paper highlights the shared journey to date, focusing on strategies implemented, lessons learned, major accomplishments and recommendations offered to support QUT's academics in the transition to a criterion-referenced university.
