This essay examines the possibilities for peace education through the teaching of history, with a specific focus on the Queensland Senior Modern History Curriculum.  An examination is made of the major themes within the Curriculum, namely, nationalism, internationalism, economic history, Asian and Australian history, imperialism, neo-imperialism, racism, and recent social and cultural history, and within each of these it is argued that there are substantive possibilities for teaching the value of peace.
