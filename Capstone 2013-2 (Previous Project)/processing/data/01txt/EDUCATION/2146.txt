Research confirms that people learn more effectively by active enquiry rather  than passive reception and through experimentation and collaboration.  Collaborative problem solving comprises a set of skills that are considered  necessary for success in todayâ€™s world (Oâ€™Neil et al. 2003). Importantly, the  development of such skills requires a learning/teaching approach that  combines both problem centred learning and collaborative/co-operative  learning (Nelson 1999). The COPS project seeks to go beyond current Online  Learning and Teaching (OLT) resources to provide a framework and system  to create and deploy environments where teams of undergraduate learners at  Queensland University of Technology can collaborate, engage, grapple and  seek to make sense of authentic problems within an online environment. It  will do so by creating problem centred 'learning designs' that can be  integrated with face to face teaching to bridge the gap between the classroom  and real world experience. This paper introduces the teaching and learning  philosophy behind COPS and explains our approach to developing this new  online tool.
