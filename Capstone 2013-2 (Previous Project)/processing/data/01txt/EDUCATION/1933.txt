The position of women in Australian society, and other westernized countries has not improved greatly.  Over the past two decades, a variety of feminist frameworks have been put forward to explain women's almost absence from formal leadership positions and highlight the various barriers that have contributed to this situation.  In this book chapter we argue that the dominant culture of educational institutions is masculine.  Thus valued practices are those which support competition, hierarchy and individualism (Blackmore 1997), while more feminine models of caring, concern and consensus are devalued or ignored.  Because of this incomplete picture, our chapter outlines some important principles and relevant practices that create more feminine ways of leading organizations.
