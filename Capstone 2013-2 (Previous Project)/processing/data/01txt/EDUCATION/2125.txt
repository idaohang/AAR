Engendering sophisticated epistemological beliefs (beliefs about knowing and learning) in student teachers is a critical function of higher education.  We report the preliminary results of a collaborative teaching unit and study examining the development of epistemological beliefs among early childhood pre-service teachers (N = 65).  The program was unique in that it promoted sophisticated beliefs through explicit reflection on both personal epistemology and content related to research methods.  Explicit reflection on the nature of beliefs about knowing and learning has been shown to impact on the development of studentsâ€™ personal epistemology.  In this study, such reflection took place through tutorial discussions, practicum reflections and students interviewing critical friends about epistemological beliefs.  Personal epistemology was also developed through a focus on research methods as the content of the course, which provided students with a first-hand experience of using evidenced-based knowledge â€“ a key component of sophisticated personal epistemologies. Students were both the subject of, and joint researchers in the study.  The program taught, and the study utilized, quantitative and qualitative research methods. Changes in epistemological beliefs were assessed pre- and post-test using Schommerâ€™s epistemological questionnaire.  The results demonstrate the utility of explicit reflection and genuine experience in research pedagogy in developing sophisticated epistemological beliefs.
