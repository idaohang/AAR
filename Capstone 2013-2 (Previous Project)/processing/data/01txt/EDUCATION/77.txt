New technologies are challenging the traditional view of teaching and learning in higher education. Students also are asking for teaching and learning approaches that allow them greater flexibility in when, where and how they learn. Responses to these new imperatives must, however, be grounded by a commitment to quality teaching and learning outcomes for students.   This paper is based on an ongoing teaching and learning project to develop a quality assurance package for online delivery of units across the Law Faculty at QUT. The paper critically evaluates criteria for assessing unit suitability for online delivery; guidelines for differing bands (full/partial) for online delivery of units; and duty statements for online unit coordinators. The process is grounded in educational theory; for example, Laurillardâ€™s principled approach to mediating student learning using technology (1993), and Ramsdenâ€™s work on effective teaching in higher education (1992). The project represents a considered move by the Faculty to ensure decisions to adopt online delivery will be addressed in a systematic, coherent and pedagogically sound manner.
