Purpose â€“ We have developed an educational model that operates at the undergraduate level and aims to produce graduates who can comfortably operate in the gulf between laboratory bench and the commercial marketplace.  This paper describes the course, approaches, activities and initial outcomes of the Bachelor of Biotechnology Innovation at Queensland University of Technology.  Approach â€“ Students undertake &quot;hard science&quot; subjects and business subjects on entrepreneurship, innovation and market development.  Synthesis of these disparate disciplines is driven through formation of virtual companies that serve to contextualize subject content and provide start-up company experience across the four year course.  Student companies design biotechnology products and processes and can progress their product through initial research and development phases or undertake an industry-based internship working as a team on initial concept projects.  This focused, team-based approach to learning is contrary to traditional science courses that focus on the individual.    Findings â€“ Outcomes include graduates of high quality that have moved into positions associated with commercialisation and technology transfer where previously a PhD and MBA were required qualifications.  Other measures of course success include acceptance and promotion of the new course by business, academia and government.  Originality/value â€“ Postgraduate courses provide the most common pathway for assisted self-development of entrepreneurial skills in science and engineering graduates.  In contrast, this model aims to train entrepreneurs in technological disciplines at an undergraduate level in a framework where innovation and enterprising behaviour are embedded in the fabric of the degree.
