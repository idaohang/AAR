This paper discusses data from interviews with mathematics educators from Australasia and  Colombia on their views of, experiences in and expectations from the internationalisation  and globalisation of their discipline. International collaboration is essential for moving the discipline forward in a globalised world and avoiding the colonialism of the past - and allowing the discipline to play its role in bridging the increasing gap between developing and developed countries. The aim of this analysis is to examine some problematical aspects of this collaboration between countries of unequal &quot;power&quot; and resources.
