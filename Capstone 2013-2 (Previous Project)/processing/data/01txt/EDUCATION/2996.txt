We have argued elsewhere that global collaboration is essential for moving the discipline  forward in this globalised world - at the same time avoiding the colonialism of the past - and allowing the discipline to play its role in bridging the ever-increasing gap between countries (Atweh &amp; Clarkson, 2001b). This issue of global collaboration sets the tone for this paper. In this study we conjecture that for those who have had and continue to have an active set of international contacts and/or experiences, their appreciation of the impact of the processes of globalisation would be heightened. To gain some insight into this issue a survey was developed and distributed to Australian and New Zealand mathematics education researchers. Although we found a divergence of views that our colleagues hold across a range of issues, there does seem to be a trend for colleagues who have experienced at some depth non western cultures to appreciate more deeply some of the issues thrown into relief by the notions of globalisation. We believe that more discussion on the notions of globalisation and how it is impacting on mathematics education will challenge us all and give more depth to our thinking and practice. This in turn will position each of us to be better able to deal critically with fundamental issues in the globalised world in which our students and we now live.
