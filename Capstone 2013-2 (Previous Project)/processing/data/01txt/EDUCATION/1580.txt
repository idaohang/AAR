Changes in society and the workplace necessitate a rethinking of the nature of the mathematical problem-solving experiences we provide our students across the grades. We need to design experiences that develop a broad range of future-oriented mathematical abilities and processes. Mathematical modelling, which has traditionally been reserved for the secondary school, serves as a powerful vehicle for addressing this need. This paper reports on the second year of a three-year longitudinal study where a class of children and their teachers participated in mathematical modelling activities from the 5th grade through to the 7th grade. The paper explores the processes used by small groups of children as they independently constructed their own mathematical models at the end of their 6th grade. Our ever-changing global market is making increased demands for workers.
