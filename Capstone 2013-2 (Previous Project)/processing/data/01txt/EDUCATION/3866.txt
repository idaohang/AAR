&quot;Project: Freshwater&quot; is an orientation experience for Built Environment students  at the Queensland University of Technology. In the third week of the semester  this field trip takes the First Year cohort out of their familiar urban environment  and into an extraordinary natural setting for four days in order to facilitate goals  of socialisation, enculturation and education. It sets the tone for the whole course,  establishing a sense of belonging and group identity amongst the design  disciplines (industrial design, architecture and interior design), breaking down  traditional staff/student barriers. Students develop an awareness of each other as  emerging professionals and an awareness of the cultural diversity and a sense of  community possible within the university environment.    Through presentation and discussion of the context, structure and content of the  programme and itâ€™s five year evolution this paper explores the educational  objectives of: the development of visual and verbal communication skills;  experiencing design thinking through practical discovery; promoting  interdisciplinary thinking and approaches to design; promoting independence in  personal and group learning skills; and introducing concepts of enhanced  environmental awareness and product life cycles as informers of design intention.   The long term impact on students, future plans and suggestions for others thinking  of implementing such a programme are discussed.
