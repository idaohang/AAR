This paper reports on an ARC funded project dealing with issues of policy carriage in relation to child protection policies in the states of Queensland and New South Wales (McWilliam, Singh &amp; Sachs,2002-2004). Child protection policies enshrine the rights of the child in state legislation. However, the carriage of these policies into schools may be leading some teachers to adopt a 'risk retreat' response, that is, avoidance of any form of child touch. This paper outlines an alternative pedagogic response for teachers by drawing on two sources: theories of risk society and interview data collected from key policy actors in child protection. It argues that 'risk management' pedagogies may position teachers to take a more democratic 'power negotiated' rather than authoritarian 'power-protected' role in relation to the carriage or enactment of child protection policies in schooling practice. Such pedagogies would evolve out of 'practice frameworks' collaboratively developed by networks of school learning communities.
