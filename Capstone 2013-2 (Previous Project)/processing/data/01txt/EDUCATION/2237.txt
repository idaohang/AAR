Two principles of good teaching are encouraging active learning and  emphasizing time on task. Three logically distinct components, ability,  inclination, and sensitivity have been identified as necessary for dispositional  behaviour towards critical thinking. Not all students do possess all three, and  some may lack the discipline-sensitive imagination to develop their own  activities for their learning: this is where technology helps us devise welldesigned  exercises. Furthermore access to activities that students enjoy  interacting with should encourage them to spend more time with the  material, hence increasing â€˜time on taskâ€™ in a productive way. An on line site  was developed a couple of years ago in the unit Clinical Physiology. The site  has now been evaluated by questionnaires given to students. Results show  that access and navigation are satisfactory, but there was poor use of the few  interactive activities. The resources were perceived as useful to the learning.  Studentsâ€™ assessment in the unit is based on the discussion of case studies;  answers in examination have reflected mostly a surface approach learning:  facts, but no development of reasoning in the answers.  The results of the evaluation of the on line site and the examinations answers  motivated us to further develop the on line site with the aim of encouraging  active learning and time-on-task. Using interactive activities that are  interesting and enjoyable can help students develop inclination and  sensitivity in the thinking of the discipline.
