The claim that early childhood education benefits children, families and communities is of critical interest to educational leaders in schools and other community institutions. Indeed, a growing body of international research literature attests to its benefits for childrenâ€™s learning, health and well-being (Ball, 1994; Pascal et al., 1999). An allied area of research focuses on the benefits of integrated services (within schools and other facilities) for children, families and communities, using a social capital framework (Tayler, Tennent, Farrell &amp; Gahan, 2002; Tennent, Tayler &amp; Farrell, 2002) .     Premised on Morrowâ€™s (2001) notion that social capital in a community impacts the well-being of its members, our construct of social capital includes micro-social individual behaviour and macro-social structural factors, thus setting â€œsocial relationships, social interactions and social networks in contextâ€¿ (Morrow, 2001, p. 4). Another theoretical dimension of our work is derived from the sociology of childhood (James &amp; Prout, 1997; Mayall, 1998), where children are theorised as active social agents and reliable informants of their own experience, who construct and shape the social structures and processes of their lives (Clark, McQuail &amp; Moss, 2003).
