Integrated learning has been put forward by curriculum documents as a means to add meaning and context to mathematics and science learning. However, few models of practice exist to guide teachers' in implementing this process. This paper examines an educational researcher's and a practicing teacher's challenge to use student construction of Lego artefacts as a tool for the learning of mathematics and science concepts through technology practice. It was found that the activities afforded opportunities for students to demonstrate numerous outcomes, that explicit scaffolding was needed by some students and that some students achieved at outcome levels beyond those expected of their Year. The findings have implications for the use of activity in the teaching of mathematics and science where syllabus documents demand specific outcomes.
