This qualitative study reports on an IT integration project commissioned by the Education Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  In conjunction with two primary schools, an online integrated learning environment was designed and developed for use by all Primary Three (P3) teachers in one school and all Primary Four (P4) teachers in another.  In both schools teachers teaching Chinese, English and Mathematics were involved.  The idea is to develop these two schools to serve as models for teachers who are currently preparing to meet the information technology competency levels set by the Education Department.  The project aims to assist teachers to develop alternative teaching and learning strategies involving use of information technology to cope with individual learning differences in response to the current education reform movement.  This case-study reports on changes occurring in both teachers and students. The changes are described and the factors supporting this change are discussed. Finally, we discuss the progress made in the last eighteen months toward establishing an environment that aims to stimulate and engage a major cultural shift with Hong Kong pupils, parents and their teachers.  The resultant best practices will hopefully be accompanied by a change in beliefs, both for the pupils and teachers involved and for the many teachers in the future who may benefit from the use of the integrated learning environment.
