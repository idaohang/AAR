In this article we explore young childrenâ€™s development of mathematical knowledge and reasoning processes as they worked two modelling problems (the Butter Beans Problem and the Airplane Problem). The problems involve authentic situations that need to be interpreted and described in mathematical ways. Both problems include tables of data, together with background information containing specific criteria to be considered in the solution process. Four classes of 3rd-graders (8 years of age) and their teachers participated in the 6-month program, which included preparatory modelling activities along with professional development for the teachers. In discussing our findings we address:  (a) Ways in which the children applied their informal, personal knowledge to the problems;  (b) How the children interpreted the tables of data, including difficulties they experienced;  (c) How the children operated on the data, including aggregating and comparing data, and looking for trends and patterns;  (d) How the children developed important mathematical ideas;  (e) Ways in which the children represented their mathematical understandings.
