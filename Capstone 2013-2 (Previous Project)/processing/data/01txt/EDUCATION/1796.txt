This paper considers how postcolonial rethinking might lead educators and students to change traditional contexts and conservative, Eurocentric curricula. The paper discusses multicultural contexts such as those in Australia, and how  postcolonial curricula would extend conventional multicultural education by challenging the colonial legacies of European-derived discourses of education. Postcolonial theory is explored as a valuable approach for thinking through not only these goals of change, but also different ways of conceptualising intercultural education and the difficulties of changing the Western-derived models of schools and universities which have become global.
