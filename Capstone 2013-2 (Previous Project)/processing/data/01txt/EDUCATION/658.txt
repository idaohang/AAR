The use of textbooks in mathematics classrooms has the potential to displace a teacherâ€™s ability to shape in their learners an identity of participation. In such settings, issues of inclusion and exclusion in learning communities are revealed. Thus, some young people are shaping an identity of non-participation maintained by the practice of relying on textbooks to teach mathematics. This paper draws on research in progress to argue that the practice of using textbooks influences identities and the forms of participation in mathematics learning communities.
