Greater emphasis on core or generic skills is generating sweeping reforms across tertiary curricula, and academics now face the challenge of developing in students complex concepts and skills of which they themselves may possess limited awareness, understanding or ability.     This shift in focus demands that the academic must seek out comprehensive, specialised guidance from support areas such as libraries. In response, librarians must be positioned as key educators in the teaching and learning environments of the future. They require new and refined skills and conceptual understandings which will enable them to perform with an educational competence and professional confidence equal to that of their academic peers.    This paper will explore the skills required to enable the â€˜librarian-teacherâ€™ metamorphosis to occur. It will examine the implications for librarians and library managers in terms of evolving roles and responsibilities, changing expectations and staff development, and highlight barriers to success. The paper also documents the experiences and outcomes resulting from a recent staff development initiative undertaken by QUT Library to address this issue.
