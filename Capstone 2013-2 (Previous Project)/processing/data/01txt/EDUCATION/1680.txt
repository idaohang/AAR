This study reports on the findings of the Schools On-line Curriculum Content Initiative (SOCCI) market research project conducted in 2001 concerning the use of on-line technology by science teachers.  Specifically the study sought to define the patterns of usage, teaching and learning strategies, and conditions that favoured or inhibited the use of on-line technology. Qualitative data were drawn from classroom observations and interviews with nominated teachers and quantitative data derived from an on-line survey.  Several key findings will be discussed.  First, although science teachers tend to use on-line resources to develop their own dedicated teaching materials, the more enthusiastic teachers are spending considerable time preparing resources but may have reached a saturation point where the outcomes were not worth the effort.   Lack of support and contextual factors within schools are significant impediments.  Second, there is clear indication that students in science are using on-line technology mostly for research and information retrieval.  Most science teachers in secondary schools seem to have easy access to computers and are tending to use them in science teaching spaces. Third, common software, especially word processors, is being used to support both teachersâ€™ professional work and student learning.  Fourth, teachersâ€™ assessment of the current state of computers, their access, quantity and quality seemed to be favourable.  The paper will discuss these findings and the related range of issues and conditions that support or inhibit the use of on-line facilities.
