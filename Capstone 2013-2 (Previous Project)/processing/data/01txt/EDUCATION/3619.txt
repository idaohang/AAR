In Queensland, Indigenous mathematics performance lags at least two years behind that of non-Indigenous students (Queensland Studies Authority, 2004). This low performance is exacerbated in remote communities where teachers are generally inexperienced, non-Indigenous, usually stay in the school for two years only, and do not know how to work effectively with their Indigenous aides. This paper reports on part of a 3-year study to enhance studentsâ€™ outcomes through improving relationships between teachers, Indigenous teacher-aides, students and community members. It describes three case studies and identifies training, equality in partnerships, communication, and the â€œwesternizedâ€¿ nature of classrooms as issues for effective teacher/aide relationships.
