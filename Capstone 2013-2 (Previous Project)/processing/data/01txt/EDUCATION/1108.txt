In this article, we review briefly some of the literature from the Reggio Emilia approach that relates to documentation and how it is connected to child observation. Further, we provide a brief account of the discourses of globalization as applied to Reggio Emilia education in general and the use of documentation specifically. We conclude that the importation of the Reggio Emilia approach can be seen in part as a search for a viable alternative to the standards and accountability movement, the availability of the global locally, and the accessibility of patterns of consumption and desire.
