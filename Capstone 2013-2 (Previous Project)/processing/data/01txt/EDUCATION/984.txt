Large numbers of primary preservice student teachers' in Australia lack confidence in their own mathematical abilities and skills when entering teacher education courses. This study investigated the development of maths-confidence in sixteen self-identified maths-anxious preservice student teachers. These students were engaged in the development of their mathematical repertoires within the context of a supportive computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment. The design of the Intervention Program used in the study was informed by a theoretical framework derived from the literature in the fields of learning environments, novel open-ended mathematical activities, computer supported collaborative learning, community of learners and negative beliefs about learning. The findings from this study indicate that the continuous support from their group members via the computer-mediated Knowledge Forum community, and the support they received from the researcher and facilitator within the non-intimidating workshop environments was crucial in the development of maths-confidence in these preservice student teachers.
