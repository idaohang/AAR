Education policy discourse in the Australian state of Queensland positions schooling as a panacea to pervasive social instability and a means to achieve a new consensus.  This analysis interrogates the political strategies at work within the Queensland Government's education vision document, Queensland State Education â€“ 2010 (QSE-2010).  Policy discourse will be subjected to a double-reading and examined as strategic rhetoric (Nakayama &amp; Krizek, 1995) which 'distorts the overall frame of reference in a particular political direction' (Olssen, 2005, p. 372).  As a result, discourses within QSE-2010 are read as politically strategic, rhetorical statements that speak of a destabilised socio-political centre and an increasingly turbulent economic future.  In so doing it is argued these statements work to incite anxiety through 'the stimulation of subjectivity' (Rose, 1990, p. 4).  Further, discussion of characteristics needed by the 'desirable' future citizen of Queensland reflect efforts to 'tame change through the making of the child' (Popkewitz, 2004, p. 201).  In reaction to increasing diversity from both domestic and international migration to the traditionally conservative state of Queensland, such education policy indicates a strategic (re)visioning of centre and the relations of power tying 'individuals &quot;free to choose&quot;' (Rose, 1990, p. 4) to 'regulatory norms of participation' (Popkewitz, 2004, p. 193) that are said to underpin the political dream of a 'sovereignty of the good' (Foucault, 1988, p. 61).  The casualties of this revision and the concomitant refusal to investigate the pathologies of schooling that alienate and disenfranchise (Vlachou, 2004; Graham, 2006) are the children who do not conform to the norm of the desired future citizen and who become relegated to second tier (VET) schooling options (Education Queensland, 2000; 2002b).
