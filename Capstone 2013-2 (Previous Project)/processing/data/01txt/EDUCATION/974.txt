Large numbers of primary preservice student teachersâ€™ experience maths-anxiety  and negative beliefs when entering teacher education courses. This study  investigated the reduction of maths-anxiety in sixteen self-identified mathsanxious  preservice student teachers. These students were engaged in the  development of mathematical repertoires within the context of a supportive  computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment. The design of  the Intervention Program used in the study was informed by a theoretical  framework derived from the literature in the fields of learning environments,  novel open-ended mathematical activities, computer supported collaborative  learning, community of learners and negative beliefs about learning and teaching  mathematics. A focus for this study will be the findings from the online anxiety  survey that allowed participants to self-monitor their feelings as they engaged  with the various mathematical activities. The findings suggest that a significant  decrease in participant maths-anxiety occurred as they became aware of their  emotional state and feelings in relation to each mathematical activity
