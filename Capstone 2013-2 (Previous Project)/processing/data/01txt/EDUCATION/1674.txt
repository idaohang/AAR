It is recognised worldwide that there is a slow uptake by teachers of Information Communication Technologies in school classrooms. This study focused on determining the effectiveness of a school-based, on-site, and ongoing professional development program conducted in a primary school in Hong Kong. There were training sessions conducted by fellow teachers, and participatory action research groups to share resources and experience in incorporating ICT in teaching. Teachersâ€™ incorporation of computers in teaching was significantly increased in the first year of intervention but showed fluctuation in the second year. A number of explanations were offered by teachers in their interviews for these changes. The paper concludes with an examination of the implications of the study for teaching in primary schools.
