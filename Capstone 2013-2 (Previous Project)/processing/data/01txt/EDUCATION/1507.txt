The validity of students' reasoning is central to problem solving.  However, equally important are the operating premises from which students' reason about problems.  These premises are based on students' interpretations of the problem information.  This paper describes various premises that eleven- and twelve-year-old students derived from the information in a particular problem, and the way in which these premises formed part of their reasoning during a lesson.  The teacher's identification of differences in students' premises for reasoning in this problem shifted the emphasis in a class discussion from the reconciliation of the various problem solutions and a focus on a sole correct reasoning path, to the identification of the students' premises and the appropriateness of their various reasoning paths.  Problem information that can be interpreted ambiguously creates rich mathematical opportunities because students are required to articulate their assumptions, and, thereby identify the origin of their reasoning, and to evaluate the assumptions and reasoning of their peers.
