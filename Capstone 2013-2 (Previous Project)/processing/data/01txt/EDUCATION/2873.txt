The growing body of literature on mentoring across a variety of professional disciplines such as education, medicine, nursing, law, business, and public administration is an indication of its high profile. This paper reflects our ongoing interest in the phenomenon of mentoring and takes as its focus, pre-service teacher education mentoring programs.  In this paper we review a substantial body of the research literature that identifies the outcomes of mentoring for pre-service teachers and their mentors. We also consider some important perennial issues in the field experience / mentoring of pre-service teacher education programs which have implications for the quality of the experience for pre-service teachers.
