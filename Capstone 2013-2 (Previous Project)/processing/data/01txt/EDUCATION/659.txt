This paper draws on research in progress with early school leavers and non-completers of schooling to argue that mathematics classrooms can be usefully considered as communities of practice. In these communities of practice, social relationships are negotiated and identities are formed which can be critical for these studentsâ€™ long term success or failure in learning mathematics.  In such social settings, processes of participation and non-participation are crucial to the construction of group and individual identities, and the social skills of the teacher and her ability to communicate and engage effectively with such students can be as important as her knowledge of content.
