Information research may take many forms. When the researchers are situated within an information technology faculty, there is a natural orientation towards the technology and the systems that make possible the use of the technology.   Despite this, a focus on information itself and its effective utilisation can be achieved in an environment that may otherwise be more concerned with the technology than the information that the technology carries. This focus can contribute to research that has a systems orientation, as well as both foster and be fostered by interdisciplinary work in areas such as education, management and psychology.  Here we explain the development of a research program in â€˜information useâ€™ within the Socio-technical systems theme of the School of Information Systems at QUT. Our emphasis is on the processes â€“ research supervision, industry linkage, consultancy, grant development, conference contribution and publication - that have advanced the development of the research group.   We also provide a summary of research projects in the form of models that are being developed to help illuminate the research frameworks.
