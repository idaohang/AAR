The failure of schools to respond to the unique attributes of young gifted children is leading many parents to seek alternative schooling strategies including home schooling. A major concern is the lack of challenge that extend gifted children in ways that enhances their emotional, social and cognitive development. Because gifted children are different in their levels of emotional development, interactions with peers and learning characteristics, they require special support to ensure their giftedness is nurtured. Drawing upon experience with enrichment programs for young gifted children, the authors explore ways of establishing nurturing learning environments that do provide the opportunities for children to develop self-esteem, to be engaged in activities that generate long term interest, and to become knowledge producers.
