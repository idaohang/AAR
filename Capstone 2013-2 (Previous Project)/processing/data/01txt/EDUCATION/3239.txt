This paper explores some of the assumptions and arguments about teaching for cross-cultural understanding through the Studies of Asia. First, it examines what cross-cultural understanding might mean and why it is significant. Second, it reviews some of the past discussion and debate about how it can be achieved. Third, it argues that global and regional realities indicate that Australian students require cross-cultural understanding through the Studies of Asia if they are to be effective citizens in the region.
