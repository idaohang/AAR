This project proposes a â€˜feed forwardâ€™ skill developmental model of cognitive assessment in relation to cognitive self-concepts for children over initial short intervals of time.  Study 1 was a cross-sectional design with 5 to 11 year old children (N = 186). Study 2 was a longitudinal design with 5 to 8 year old children (N = 135).  In one-to-one sessions, children completed the SYSTEMS School-Years Screening Test for the Evaluation of Mental Status (Ouvrier, Hendy, Bornholt &amp; Black, 1999, 2000) and ASK-KIDS self-concepts inventory (Bornholt, 1996) extended to cognitive activities (Black, 2001, Black &amp; Bornholt, 2000).  Study 1 showed that childrenâ€™s self-concepts and test scores were unrelated.  Study 2 confirmed that performance and self concepts are separate aspects, and showed that over initial brief intervals of time cognitive assessments feed forward to subsequent self-concepts.  Findings have implications for assessment and early interventions in clinical and educational settings.     Childrenâ€™s self-concepts seem under researched in relation to the cognitive activities that are commonly used in assessment situations by school counsellors, psychologists, neurologists and other professionals who work with children to support their learning (Bornholt, Black, Ouvrier &amp; Hendy, 1999; Stankov &amp; Crawford, 1997).  Understanding childrenâ€™s cognitive development is regarded as somewhat incomplete unless we also understand childrenâ€™s self concepts about cognitive activities (Bjorklund, 1995).  This project therefore examined the relation between childrenâ€™s performance and their self concepts about standard cognitive assessments.  The main issue is whether childrenâ€™s performance and self concepts are associated, and how these links develop over time.
