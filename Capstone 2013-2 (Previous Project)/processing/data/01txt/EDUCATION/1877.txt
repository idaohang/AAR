My concern in this article is the on going debate about how to balance two key aspects of social justice - redistribution and recognition of difference - in gender equity policy. In the paper I analyse the history of gender equity reform in relation to difference, with particular emphasis on Indigenous issues, applying recent theoretical understandings about equity and difference.   The paper documents how discourses of difference were framed and addressed in four major gender equity policy documents produced at the national level in Australia.  In particular there is an emphasis on how the redistribution-recognition dilemma is handled in the documents.
