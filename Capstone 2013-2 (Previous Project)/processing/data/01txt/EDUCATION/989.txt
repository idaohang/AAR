The case of L v Minister for Education provides an excellent example of the complexity of the ethical decisions teachers are sometimes required to make. But how can we gauge the soundness of the teacher's choices? Using this legal case as its focus, the paper will first examine issues of meta-ethics, drawing some conclusions about the ontological and epistemological status of moral claims. The paper will then address issues of normative ethics, examining consequentialist, deontological and virtue ethics as models for teacher conduct. Finally, these models will be applied to the ethical problems raised in the case. The central intention of the paper is to raise some concerns over the decisions made in L v Minister for Education, primarily regarding issues of social justice.
