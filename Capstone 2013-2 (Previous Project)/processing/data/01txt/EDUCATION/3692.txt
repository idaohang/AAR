The Integrated Learning Environment (ILE) is a web-based learning environment. It is designed to support learner and group-centred work and concentrates on facilitating teachers to easily create and develop individualised study plans within the ILE. It allows teachers to progressively assess their studentâ€™s learning and to design different activities for different students according to their ability levels. As a learning environment, the ILE contains learning tools, diagnostic tools and administration tools described in the sections below. By using these online tools, teachers of Chinese, English and Mathematics in primary schools can be encouraged to integrate formative assessment tasks, and a greater variety of interactive activities into their teaching and learning repertoire. This tool enabled teachers to implement student-centred learning modes which closely align with the current thrust of the education reform activities in Hong Kong schools.
