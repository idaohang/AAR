The development of the capacity for self-regulation represents a major achievement of childhood that is associated with social, behavioural and academic competence. Most research has focused on self-regulated academic learning in school-aged children and adolescents, neglecting developmental aspects of self-regulation. This paper reports a longitudinal study of 44 children from early to middle childhood. At age 2, the Goodman Lock Box provided information about the extent to which childrenâ€™s approaches were systematic and planful, as opposed to random, impulsive and disorganised. The same measure was used in a modified form at age 8, and two additional measures of planning and self-control were added: the Porteus Maze Test and the Grocery Shopping Task. At both ages, Lock Box competence was related to planfulness, and there was a significant correlation of Lock Box competence across the two ages. However, the various measures of self-regulation were unrelated. Several measurement issues are highlighted, in particular the difficulties associated with making assumptions about the intent and meaning of childrenâ€™s task behaviours.
