'Draw a diagram' is one of the strategies that teachers often suggest to students who are having difficulty with a problem.  However, despite the value of diagrams in problem solving, many students are reluctant to 'draw a diagram' and need to be taught how to draw effective diagrams that represent the problem information.  This paper presents an overview of four general purpose diagrams that are particularly helpful in mathematical problem solving.  It also describes an instructional program on general purpose diagrams that was implemented with ten-year-olds. Providing students with explicit instruction about diagrams enables them to capitalise on the cognitive advantages of diagram use in problem solving.
