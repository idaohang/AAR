Students with Asperger's syndrome present a particular challenge for their parents, teachers, and peers. Therefore it is important for teachers working in inclusive settings to become aware of the unique needs of these students. In this paper, challenges for students with Asperger's syndrome are discussed in terms of five aspects; communication, motor clumsiness, obsessional interests, attention and social skills. These characteristics are discussed in a wav that will facilitate teachers' understanding of the difficulties associated with student participation in the school environment. Challenges for teachers are discussed under the headings: inclusive schooling; need for a structured program; behaviour management; communication; and creativity in planning. Adaptive and compensatory strategies for teachers are described which will facilitate learning and participation of students with Asperger's syndrome in the regular classroom.
