The University of Minnesota Gopher client-server software has been widely applied for public access to Internet files and databases. On the Gopher implementation at QUT, space was set aside at a submenu level to enable information management students to build personal gopher menu hierarchies for defined subject areas. This made extension of individual menus possible beyond the inbuilt bookmark facility, for personal definition of a broad range of menus and access points. An analysis of the range of sources used by students for inclusion in the Gopher is made. Advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed, together with suggestions for development and maintenance of subject pathways by intermediaries.
