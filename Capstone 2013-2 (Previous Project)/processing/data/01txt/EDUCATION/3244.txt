As we attempt to deal with future challenges and uncertainties, the significance of Australiaâ€™s relationship with Asia  - the region in which we are located - is of great importance. Yet, it could be argued that Australians know less about Asia than other parts of the world. This article argues that Principals can demonstrate their commitment to building 'bridges of knowledge, respect and empathy' (Cosgrove 2002) in two ways. First, they need to inform their school's broad community about the importance of knowledge and understanding about Asia and its languages for our future. Asia-literate Australians will be vital for our economic prosperity, cultural communication and strategic needs. Second, Principals need to exercise leadership in schools to ensure that the study of Asia and its languages is firmly established in the curriculum.
