This study compared the coping strategies and styles of 30 learning disabled adolescents with 30 non learning disabled adolescents matched in age, gender and ethnicity from a large urban high school in Queensland. Results showed that the learning disabled adolescents use some different coping styles and stratÂ¬egies to their non learning disabled peers. The learning disabled group showed less tendency to relax, or work to achieve goals. They tended not to focus on the positive and not to attempt to solve problems. Rather they exhibited a higher tendency to use wishful thinking and believed that they could not cope. CogniÂ¬tive and social skills deficits are proposed as the likely contributors to the difÂ¬ferences. The implications of these findings are discussed.
