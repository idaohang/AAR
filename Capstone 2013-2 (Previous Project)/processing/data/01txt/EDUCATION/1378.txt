This paper reports on a pilot study for a prototype VRLE (Virtual Reality Learning Environment) named VRMath.  The two primary school students who were involved in this study engaged in two VRMath learning activities designed by the researchers.  The results indicated that 3D navigation within the VR 3D space was difficult. However, it could be aided with the navigation aids designed within VRMath. The 3D navigation within the 3D virtual space also caused the participants confusion in terms of their spatial visualisation and orientation abilities. The construction of 3D geometrical objects within VRMath was also difficult especially when the participants were operating the 3D rotation mentally and physically with respect to their body (i.e., the egocentric frame of reference).  It was found that the simultaneously use of different frames of reference could help the construction of 3D geometrical objects.  During the learning activities, issues about the usability of VRMath were also explored.
