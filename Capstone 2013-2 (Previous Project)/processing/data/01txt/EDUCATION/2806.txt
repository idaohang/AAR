To interrogate pedagogical discourses relating to child behaviour as â€˜practices that systematically form the objects of which they speakâ€™ (Foucault, 1972, p.54), this paper features the analysis of three texts.  The principle text is a statement describing problematic child behaviour in school.  Of concern is how this particular statement functions â€“ what does it do and with what effects?  In examining the function of this statement, analysis will be informed by the examination of two other texts.  Each demonstrate techniques in the production of meaning; specifically how the use of performative language and intertextual reference contribute to and enhance the constitutive properties of discourse.  The aim is first to â€˜try to grasp subjection in its material instance as a constitution of subjectsâ€™ (Foucault, 1980b, p.97) through the interrogation of discursive practices that objectify and subjugate the individual; and second, to call attention to the dangers inherent to the ways in which problematic child behaviour is described in schools.
