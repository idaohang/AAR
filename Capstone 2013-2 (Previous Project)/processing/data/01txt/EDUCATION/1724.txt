This phenomenological study investigated the social experiences and perceptions of friendship among teenagers diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. Data were collected through the use of semi-structured interviews from five secondary school students in Australia. Data analysis resulted in the identification of a number of recurring themes used to illustrate the words of the young people in the study. These themes and words inform the reader by providing real experience of the characteristics of people who have Asperger's Syndrome that are emerging in the growing research: (1) description of social experiences - both difficult and satisfactory (2) description of hostile encounters with peers (3) need for following rules and (4) 'masquerading'. Masquerading is a term used to describe the facade, which some individuals with Asperger's syndrome adopt in order to mask their social differences. This type of study enables professionals to enter the worlds of adolescents who have Asperger's syndrome, by describing and analyzing the social phenomena found there. Although professionals have the goal of assisting young people with Asperger's syndrome to participate in ,socially accepted ways', there is also an obligation to recognise and value different persons' social perspectives. The findings of this study could inform a more subtle approach to social skill programmes for adolescents with Asperger's syndrome
