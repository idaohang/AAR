The relationship between mental computation and number sense is complex: mental computation can facilitate number sense when students are encouraged to be flexible, but flexibility and number sense is neither sufficient nor necessary for accuracy in mental computation. It is possible for familiarity with a strategy to compensate for a lack of number sense and inefficient processes.  This study reports on six case studies exploring Year 3 studentsâ€™ procedures for and understanding of mental addition and subtraction, and understanding of number sense and other cognitive, metacognitive, and affective factors associated with mental computation.  The case studies indicate that the mental computation process is composed of four stages in which cognitive, metacognitive and affective factors operate differently for flexible and inflexible computers.  The authors propose a model in which the differences between computer types are seen in terms of the application of different knowledges in number facts, numeration, effect of operation on number, and beliefs and metacognition on strategy choice and strategy implementation.
