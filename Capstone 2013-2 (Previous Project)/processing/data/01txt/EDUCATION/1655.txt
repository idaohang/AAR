In this paper, we report on the ways in which two middle grade teachers listened to and supported their studentsâ€™ mathematical reasoning within the context of a modelling task in data analysis. The teachers implemented a sequence of tasks that focused on the development of rating systems through selecting, ranking, and aggregating quantities. Analyses of the teachersâ€™ practices suggested that: (a) the teachersâ€™ mathematical backgrounds governed their understanding of both the modeling task and the studentsâ€™ reasoning; (b) the teachers adopted new roles in their interactions with the students, including a focus on listening and observing, and on asking questions for understanding and clarification; and (c) while both teachers were responsive to their studentsâ€™ actions and strongly supported their learning, they did so in different ways and with different emphases. This study illustrates the potential for developing a knowledge base for teaching by shifting the focus of research from teachersâ€™ actions to the interpretations that lead to those actions.
