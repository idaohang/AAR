The focus of this study was to investigate mental computation conceptual frameworks that Heirdsfield (2001c) formulated to explain the difference between proficient (accurate and flexible) mental computers and accurate (but not flexible) mental computers.  A further aim was to explore the potential for studentsâ€™ developing efficient mental strategies.
