In Australia, both the federal government and most states are committing considerable funds to enhancing science education, and in particular advocating special support for the most gifted students.  These students are seen as crucial contributors to a technological society in coming generations. The provision of support for gifted students is often left to learning support teachers or gifted and talented co-ordinators.  Rarely do teachers of science provide gifted students with opportunities for enrichment within the formal school structures.  This is despite the strong interest that many gifted children have in science from a very young age.  In this article, we explore the issue of why gifted students should receive special attention and highlight some of the broad strategies that can be implemented to support gifted students.  The education of gifted students in science has received scant attention in the literature despite considerable advances being made in the field (e.g., Heller, MÃ¶nks, Sternberg, &amp; Subotnik, 2000).  Although, many of the strategies developed in gifted education will particularly benefit gifted students they are also of value to all students studying science.
