Models and modeling (M&amp;M) research often investigates the nature of understandings and abilities that are needed in order for students to be able to use what they have (presumably) learned in the classroom in &quot;real life&quot; situations beyond school.  Nonetheless, M&amp;M perspectives evolved out of research on concept development more than research on problem solving; and, rather than being preoccupied with the kind of word problems emphasized in textbooks and standardised tests, we focus on (simulations of) problem solving &quot;in the wild&quot;.  Also, we give special attention to the fact that, in a technology-based &quot;age of information&quot;, significant changes are occurring in the kinds of &quot;mathematical thinking&quot; that is coming to be needed in the everyday lives of ordinary people in the 21st century - as well as in the lives of productive people in future-oriented fields that are heavy users of mathematics, science, and technology.
