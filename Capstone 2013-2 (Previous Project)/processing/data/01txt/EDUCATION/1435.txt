This paper reports changes in childrenâ€™s mental computation solution strategies for multiplication and division applied word problems (involving 1, 2 and 3-digit numbers combinations).  The study followed 95 Queensland children from Year 4 through to the end of Year 6.  The childrenâ€™s responses showed a development from simple counting to use of derived or known facts for small number combinations, and from counting to quite complex and creative strategies to algorithmic procedures for large number combinations.  There was some evidence of instructional effects in the increased use of the taught algorithms, the continued use of counting strategies.  There was, at times, sustained use of wholistic.
