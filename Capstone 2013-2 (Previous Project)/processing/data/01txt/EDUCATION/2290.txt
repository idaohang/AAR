Increased enrolment in the non-government school sector, provision of full-time preparatory year programs in non-government schools, the current trial of a full-time preparatory year in Queensland schools, and the paucity of research into parent views of preparatory year programs necessitate research into these phenomena.  This paper mounts a case for research using a phenomenographic approach to explore the qualitatively different ways that parents view the preparatory year. Findings from this research have the potential to contribute to current debates surrounding the Preparing for School trial in Queensland.
