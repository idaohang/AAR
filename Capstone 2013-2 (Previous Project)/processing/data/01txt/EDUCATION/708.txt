IFN001:Advanced Information Retrieval (AIRS) is a mandatory coursework requirement of doctoral enrolment at QUT. It aims to assist research students in working toward their literature review through the development of advanced information literacy knowledge and practice. In response to increasing remote and offshore doctoral enrolments, and to support the Universityâ€™s objectives regarding flexible delivery and online teaching, QUT Library has led the development of an innovative online course. From 2005,  AIRS Online is available as a parallel option to the face-to-face mode. AIRS Online provides a student-focussed learning environment which encourages deep learning and caters for diverse learning styles and needs. It is founded on the principle that the simple transfer of content to an online environment will not deliver equivalent learning outcomes for students. Unlike a passive web-based tutorial, the course has been designed to actively engage students in teacher-facilitated, self-directed learning. Integrating content and educational technology and linking across dual IT platforms, the development of AIRS Online has necessitated diverse partnering across the University between Library teaching and systems staff and various online, multimedia and web support staff. This paper explores the pedagogical, technical and administrative partnerships, issues and outcomes of re-crafting an existing classroom-based course for an online environment.
