The aim of this paper is to question traditional neomarxist western understandings of student resistance within the context of postwar Japanese student resistance. The paper traces the lineage of several theoretical contributions that ultimately led to the now iconic positioning of resistance produced by the Birmingham School in the 1980s. The paper argues that the most influential understandings of western educational resistance during the 1970s and 1980s were premised on notions of an informal, disorganized and apolitical understanding of agency. By tracing the development of postwar Japanese educational resistance (1948 to 1975) this paper questions the ability of such western theories of resistance to embrace forms of collectivity inherent within the Japanese context. At the heart of the paper is therefore the central question of how applicable were historical sets of neomarxist understandings of resistance to cultural, theoretical and ideological forms of 'counter-hegemony' removed from Western settings.
