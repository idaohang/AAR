This paper discusses how the involvement of young people in &quot;real&quot; research activities can be an effective pedagogy for learning for mathematics as well other life skills. However, such collaboration with young people presents dilemmas to their teachers. The concepts of productive pedagogy developed by one school reform movement in Australia are used to reflect on the SARUA project that works for students from underrepresented backgrounds in higher education.
