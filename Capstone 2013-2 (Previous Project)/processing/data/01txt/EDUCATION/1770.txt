This paper explores one component of Basil Bernsteinâ€™s complex theoretical framework dealing with the conversion or translation of knowledge into pedagogic communication.  The pedagogic device is described by Bernstein as the ensemble of rules or procedures via which knowledge is converted into classroom talk, curricula and online communication.  It is argued that Bernsteinâ€™s theory of the pedagogic device provides researchers with explicit criteria/rules to describe the macro and micro structuring of knowledge, and in particular the generative relations of power and control constituting knowledge. The paper elaborates on the components of the pedagogic device and provides examples of empirical studies utilising this theoretical framework.
