Beyond Look &amp; Learn: Investigating, implementing and evaluating interactive programs for promoting young childrenâ€™s learning in museums aims to establish policies and practices which strengthen the potential for young childrenâ€™s learning in museums by:  * documenting the characteristics of young children as learners in museums;  * identifying social interactions which promote young childrenâ€™s learning in museums;  * analysing museum policies in relation to young childrenâ€™s learning; and  * developing strategies for building strong links between museums, schools and families.    Project activities:  * Case studies of young childrenâ€™s learning in each museum  * Front - end planning for childrenâ€™s participation in museum exhibitions  * On-site evaluation of visitor response (young children, families, school visitors)  * Policy review  * Training of on-site research and design teams
