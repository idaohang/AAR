As university teachers we find ourselves grappling with the increasingly diverse  legacies of studentsâ€™ prior pedagogic experiences â€“ some of which seem to work against  the quality intellectual outcomes now demanded from higher education. In this context,  this paper reports a descriptive study of pedagogy created for Chinese students in a  mainstream Australian secondary school with a high level of tertiary entry. An  influential literature on student learning in higher education has pointed to the  constraining effects of bothWestern and Chinese secondary schooling on university  studentsâ€™ learning. In the case of Chinese students who enter Western universities from  Western secondary schools, the picture is complicated by research indicating that  students of English as a Second Language (ESL) receive even more constraining forms  of pedagogy than their native-English-speaking peers. A framework of Bernsteinian  sociological concepts and discourse analytic concepts was employed in the study  reported here to explore this possibility. Implications are drawn for managing the  transition of ESL students to university contexts, and for reflecting on our own  responses to linguistic and cultural diversity in the tutorial room.
