Technology has long held significant promise as an aid to language teachers and computer literacy is a key objective in many curricula. In Australia, however, the use of online technology in schools is quite new and language teachers are still coming to terms with the possibilities of the new tools and resources available. This paper reports on a recent survey of the use of online teaching in Australian schools which found that even teachers nominated for their use of technology and enthusiastic about its potential are still only occasional users. The major issues influencing these teachers include ease of access and the need for technical and pedagogic support in order to go beyond replicating traditional classroom practices to realise the potential of the new learning opportunities created by interactive technology.
