This paper reports on a study of two childrenâ€™s mental computation in addition and subtraction, and compares their mental architecture.  Both students were identified as being accurate, however, one student used a variety of mental strategies (was flexible) while the other student used only one strategy that reflected the written procedure for each of the addition and subtraction algorithms taught in the classroom.  Interviews were used to identify both childrenâ€™s knowledge and ability with respect to number sense (including numeration, number and operations, basic facts, estimation), metacognition and affects.  Frameworks were developed to show how these factors interacted to explain the two types of accuracy in mental addition and subtraction.  Flexible accuracy was related to the presence of strong number sense knowledge integrated with metacognitive strategies and beliefs and beliefs about self and teaching; while inflexible accuracy was a result of compensation of inadequate knowledge supported by beliefs about self and teaching.
