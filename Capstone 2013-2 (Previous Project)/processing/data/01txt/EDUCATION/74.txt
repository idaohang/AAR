There appears to be general agreement that emerging technologies and in particular the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) are powerful tools and have a significant role to play in academic work and its transformations As the role of technology in university teaching increases, then a corresponding growth of literature and activity in and about the scholarship of teaching with technology would be a desirable parallel. Few authors explore the nature of the role of technology assisted teaching in teaching scholarship though there is a recognition that teaching with technology has presented opportunities for reflective practice for many who engage with it.    Is it possible to enhance the engagement of academics with the scholarship of teaching through a process of supported evaluation of â€œteaching with technologyâ€¿ strategies and associated target learner development?  This paper provides a synthesis of models by which the scholarship of teaching may be conceptualised and then explores how engagement with educational technology may trigger and focus a journey of scholarship in university teaching
