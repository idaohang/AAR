International contacts between educators from around the world continue to escalate with the increasing ease of travel and communication and the globalisation of educational concerns and issues. Social justice concerns about such contacts are important considerations to avoid exploitation and colonialisation of less affluent nations. This paper discusses the concept of &quot;injustice&quot; as developed by Young (1990) and concerns raised by academics in an international research project on unjust practices and outcomes of some international activities. Finally, by means of achieving this, it attempts to give voice to educators from less industrialised countries whose voices are not often heard in Australian conferences.
