Multimedia has potential to provide great value to educational experiences. This value can be seen in the development of new resources; the capacity to facilitate deep situated learning and transfer to real life situations; and meeting the needs of individuals. Against this, a number of factors inhibit the realisation of the potential of multimedia. These factors have been identified as predominantly resource based, with lack of time, people, finance and skill being predominant. Then again, poor design, technology lag, legal issues and sheer inertia amongst staff are also seen to inhibit effective implementation of multimedia in education institutions. It is only by initiating simultaneous change in the technological, human services and management realms that the potential for multimedia can be fully realised in educational settings.
