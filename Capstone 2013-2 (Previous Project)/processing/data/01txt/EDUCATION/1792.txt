This paper reports what five Australian teachers suggest are the learner characteristics of 'Asian' English as Foreign Language (EFL) secondary school and college students.  In their semi-structured interview accounts, the teachers suggest that one group of 'Asian' EFL students, Indonesian students, exhibit two opposing sets of learner characteristics.  The students are described as 'typically passive, shy and/or quiet' learners.  The teachers also nominate learner characteristics that are at odds with the aforementioned stereotype.  The teachers' accounts suggest that particular cultural and institutional demands, and English language proficiencies determine which set of learner characteristics become dominant in which contexts.  The paper concludes that teachers of EFL students need to be cognisant of the effect of context rather than working on the assumption that learner characteristics are static across place.
