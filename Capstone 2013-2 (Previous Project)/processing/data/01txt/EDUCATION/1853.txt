One approach to providing a mathematically rich curriculum is to involve young children in mathematical investigations in which they engage in the exploration of meaningful problems, and problem posing.  However, there is limited research on how teachers can facilitate young childrenâ€™s learning through investigations.  This study explored the difficulties seven-to-eight year old students experienced when they began an investigatory program.  We present examples of specific difficulties students confronted in conceptualising and conducting investigations, as well as general difficulties that they experienced which hindered their investigations, such as limited observation skills.  Our contention is that mathematical investigations can enhance young childrenâ€™s learning provided that their difficulties are addressed.
