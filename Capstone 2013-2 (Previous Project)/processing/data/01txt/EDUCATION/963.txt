In this paper we report on a study of pedagogic practices surrounding novice readers of digital texts in four early childhood classrooms in Queensland, Australia. Until recently, digital literacies have been generally resisted, dismissed or overlooked by early childhood teachers in early reading agendas. However, there is now considerable pressure on Australian teachers to plan within a multiliteracies framework and to include digital texts into their classroom programs. In Queensland, for example, 'New Basics' reforms of public education hold teachers accountable in this regard, especially as the tasks relating to new basics include multiple text forms and modes of delivery. In this context, it is concerning that recent Australian research has found a surprisingly low level of understanding of digital literacies, and confidence in teaching these, on the part of both practising teachers and new graduates. The aim of this paper is to inform professional development in this field by describing and explaining the digital reading pedagogies that some teachers are creating.
