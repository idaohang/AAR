In this paper I begin by proposing a cross-disciplinary model for enhancing access to science literacy for a diverse range of students at the junior secondary school. My goal is to present a new discourse-oriented perspective on the problem of overwhelming alienation from science, which, as indicated in major national reports, still tends to persist at this level in spite of â€˜science for allâ€™ policies in most countries. The model has resulted from research in 30 science classrooms, in the majority of which a diverse range of students were engaging with science and had positive attitudes towards their science class. I then illustrate the model, using critical discourse analysis (CDA) and excerpts from a science lesson for special needs Year 9-10 students in a low socioeconomic status area. Underpinned by sociolinguistic and sociological theories, CDA is a particularly useful tool for identifying subtle relational, representational, and identificational aspects of social practice - precisely those I am proposing as most significant for causing or preventing alienation for young science students.
