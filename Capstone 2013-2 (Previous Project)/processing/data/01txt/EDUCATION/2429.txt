This paper reports on an interview based study which explored the implementation of a major policy initiative in Queensland, Australia, with particular attention to social justice issues.  Interviews were conducted with key policy actors in three sections of the bureaucracy: strategic directions, performance and measurement; curriculum and assessment; and workforce and professional development.  We were interested in the ways in which the tensions between redistributive and recognitive approaches to social justice were being managed in the bureaucracy.  We drew on Bourdieuâ€™s concepts of field, logic of practice, political discourse, habitus, capital, and symbolic power struggles to theorise the politics of discourse associated with such policy implementation processes within bureaucracies.      The interview data revealed differences in approaches to equity issues and in the language used in the three sections of the bureaucracy.  We argue that these differences, associated with the different priorities of the three sections and their differing roles in the implementation processes, reflect the different logics of practice operating within the different sections.  The final section of the paper discusses the implications of the analysis for theorising equity and difference in education policy in new times, and considers the value of Bourdieuâ€™s concepts for theorising policy implementation processes.
