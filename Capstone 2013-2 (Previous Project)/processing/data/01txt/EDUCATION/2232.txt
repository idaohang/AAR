This paper draws from an ethnographic study of an online MBA unit offered by an Australian university to an internationalised student group, and focuses on the eruption of interactive troubles around issues of technological functionality (as opposed to its malfunctioning). Drawing on Wertheimâ€™s (1999) theorisation of cyberspace as  a construction of utopian dreaming, Burbules and Callisterâ€™s (2000) distinction between designed space and populated place, and Green &amp; Bigumâ€™s (1993) description of aliens and natives in the classroom, particular incidents of trouble surrounding presumptive designs of functionality are analysed. The paper warns against the pedagogical â€˜presumption of competenceâ€™ given its inevitable flipside of â€˜critical illiteracyâ€™, then argues for more research that goes looking for trouble and acknowledges the dystopian aspects of technophilic dreaming.
