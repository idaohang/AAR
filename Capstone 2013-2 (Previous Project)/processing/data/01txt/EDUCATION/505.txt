This paper identifies issues from Australian case law that are associated with the management of the inclusion of students with disabilities in Australian schools. Examples from disability discrimination case law are analysed and discussed according to the contexts of the student and school situation and the requirements of the law. Strategic approaches for the lawful management of inclusion are then suggested so that schools and principals are able to proactively manage inclusion and reduce the incidence of unlawful disability discrimination in schools.
