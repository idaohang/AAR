One-hundred and forty-four Year 1 children (51% boys and 49% girls, mean age 6) from Queensland State primary schools participated in a study to investigate the relationship between working memory and cognitive functioning.   Children were given two tests of cognitive functioning (the School-Years Screening Test for the Evaluation of Mental Status (SYSTEMS) and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT)) and six subtests of working memory from the Working Memory Test Battery for Children (WMTB-C) (Backward Digit Recall, Listening Recall, Digit Recall, Word List Matching, Word List Recall and Non-word List Recall).  The two cognitive tests correlated at r = .50.  Results showed a high correlation between SYSTEMS and the Phonological Loop (PL) component of working memory.  The K-BIT also correlated highly with PL component.  The SYSTEMS and K-BIT showed various levels of correlation with the working memory sub-tests.  A measurement model utilising Confirmatory Factor Analysis method showed a strong relationship between working memory and cognitive functioning, the degree of fit for the model was very high at GFI = .996.
