This study explores how an online integrated learning environment (ILE) to cater for individual learning differences is used by teachers in two primary schools in Hong Kong.  The findings reveal a positive change in both perception and pedagogy of the participants.  Results indicate that students were better catered for and scaffolding activities led to an enhanced ability to engage in independent learning.  Principals and teachers were prepared to alter systemic structures to support the use of the ILE.  During the three year period, teachers developed coping strategies which led to ICT-enriched learning, provision of extended learning opportunities and development of study units for online delivery.  Evidence also suggests that the adoption of the ILE allowed teachers to pay fresh attention to the need to engage students, to respond to them properly and efficiently and to ensure that each step of the way the students fully understand the work they are doing and that the work set is at an appropriate level.
