Current literature suggests that the relationship between andragogy and pedagogy is based on a continuum. This study found that the relationship of andragogical and pedagogical orientations, measured by the Students' Orientation Questionnaire, is more correctly represented as being orthogonal or at right angles to each other. Such an orthogonal relationship reflects the complexities involved in adult learning. This paper discusses the implications for both the learning process and for future research.
