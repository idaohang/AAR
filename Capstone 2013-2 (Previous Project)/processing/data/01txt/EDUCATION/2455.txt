This paper problematises the Discourses surrounding systemic whole-school initiatives, and provides some insight into how one rural primary school is dealing with such change, through the development of positioned, fictional narratives from the key players.  Systemic initiatives such as these, seek to go beyond structural or superficial change, rather the focus is on changing the â€˜literacy cultureâ€™ of the school.  Results from this project however, suggest that teachers in this context do not necessarily â€˜buy intoâ€™ such change, so the problem of â€˜imposed innovationâ€™ without real pedagogical change has developed.
