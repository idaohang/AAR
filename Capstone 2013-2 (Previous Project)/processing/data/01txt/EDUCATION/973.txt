This paper examines qualitative perspectives that principals in schools have of the disability discrimination legislation. Perspectives from in-depth interviews with six school principals and two focus groups of twenty-eight principals describe attitudes toward the disability discrimination legislation, particularly as these attitudes relate to the governance of inclusion. The study found that a reduced level of knowledge of the disability discrimination legislation and vague, ineffectual inclusive education policies contributed to leadership problems in the governance of inclusion. A combination of such factors increased stressful, reactive decision-making responses from principals particularly when complex school situations related to students with disabilities and challenging behaviours. The study proposed that collaborative decision-making to create shared understandings about disability issues was more effective in creating inclusive school cultures than the imposed requirements of the disability discrimination legislation.
