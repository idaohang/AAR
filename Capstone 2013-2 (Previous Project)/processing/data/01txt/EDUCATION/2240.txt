The paper argues that a significant body of staff within the academy remain  resistant to using new technologies within their teaching. It is suggested that  the current paradigm targeting increased staff uptake within the in-house  Learning Management Systems (LMS) has failed due to an over reliance on  policy, fundamental flaws in translating and disseminating the work of earlyadaptors,  and an over reliance on tool-based professional development. The  paper highlights the importance of providing clusters of staff with radically  different mechanisms through which a pedagogical understanding of their  teaching can be applied to a contextualized online environment. Here the  Innovation, Technology and Pedagogy project (ITP) is presented as an  alternative means of engaging with the LMS and also as an alternative  means of generating new communities of learning centred on authentic  online pedagogical engagement. The paper argues that the academy must  continue to explore alternative models that allow for the full spectrum of staff  to be included in a process of documenting, storing and disseminating  techniques of learning and teaching with technology.
