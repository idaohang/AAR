A key strategy for the development of lifelong learners is the integration of information literacy principles and skills into course curriculum. To enable such a strategy, librarians must develop their teaching expertise and foster educational partnerships with course designers and academics.    It is essential that pre-service courses and library staff development programs provide opportunities for the development of teaching skills, knowledge and abilities. This will enable shared understandings of teaching and learning outcomes between, and strengthen teaching partnerships with, academics and librarians, thereby facilitating the integration of Information Literacy into the curriculum. For the librarians, these programs can foster confidence in their own teaching abilities and add value to their personal contributions to the educational process.  This approach to staff development also emphasises the educational role of the Library in a teaching and learning environment.    This paper briefly examines the potential benefits of this philosophy for both the library teaching staff and information literacy in higher education and identifies the elements which may be addressed in a staff development program, such as curriculum design, learning outcomes, learning styles and evaluation. It will also highlight a range of options for staff development programs and discuss issues for future consideration.
