The identification and categorization of the â€˜childâ€™ as a distinctive kind of human subject coincided with the formation of the European nation state, the proliferation of mercantile economies and calls for mass literacy and secular schooling (Luke, 1989). There is a longstanding and powerful connection between â€˜childhoodâ€™ as an ontological and cultural category and what Benedict  Anderson (1991) called â€˜print capitalismâ€™.
