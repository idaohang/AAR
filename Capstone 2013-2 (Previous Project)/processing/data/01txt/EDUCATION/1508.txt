Mathematically gifted individuals contribute to society through their knowledge production and leadership in mathematics and other mathematically-oriented disciplines (i.e., science, engineering and technology).  In contemporary society, individuals with high-level mathematical capability are essential to ensure the prosperity of society in the &quot;knowledge economy&quot;.  However, concomitantly with the valuing of these individuals there has been a serious concern that Australia is not producing sufficient individuals with high-level mathematical capabilities.  The convergence of the appreciation of the role of the mathematically gifted and the recognition of a shortfall in numbers of individuals with mathematical capability has created a Zeitgeist â”€ &quot;a window of opportunity&quot; â”€ for enhancing the education of mathematically gifted students.  This paper discusses why there is a Zeitgeist for some mathematically gifted students and why other mathematically gifted students may not benefit from these times, and provides suggestions to improve the education of ALL mathematically gifted students.
