Queensland University of Technology (QUT) demonstrates a commitment to lifelong learning and strives to foster graduates who can function as competent professionals. In response, the University identifies a number of generic capabilities which all students should gain during the course of their study, the development of which has been undertaken as a shared responsibility by teaching staff and centralised academic-related support staff. It is within this context that QUT's teaching and learning support services (TALSS) and the library assumes responsibility for facilitating the development of information literacy and technology literacy. TALSS and the library have collaboratively developed and implemented a range of teaching and learning strategies and initiatives. This paper highlights a number of these initiatives. These initiatives are also supported by a network of specialists such as liaison librarians, student computing advisors, a transition officer and an information literacy coordinator.
