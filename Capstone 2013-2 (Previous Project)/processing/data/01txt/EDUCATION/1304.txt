The phenomenon of convergence of information technologies has been extensively canvassed in recent years.  It has been accompanied by discourse on the convergence of the information professions and suggestions that the boundaries between the professions have become much less distinct.    Some common principles have been identified, but different professional socialisation and independently developed traditions fostered by professional associations, have helped to maintain sectoral differences between entrenched groups.    An analysis is made of the extent to which the professional training models of different sectors of the information professions have common requirements.    Curriculum recommendations developed by  organisations in the information systems, are compared with models developed for the disciplines such as library and information science that have developed from a documentation orientation.     Particular reference is made to the professional training requirements in areas such as information systems, data administration, business analysis, librarianship, archives administration, and records management.    At a broad level, a variety of areas of knowledge are common to the professional training. These areas include the nature of information, organisational management, database structuring and utilisation, systems analysis, determination of information user needs, legal influences on information use, information resources and approaches to valuing information.    However, closer examination shows that differences of emphasis and application continue to be substantial.  These differences are reinforced by the positioning of courses within higher educational institutions, and the lack of a fundamental or well-articulated and commonly accepted paradigm for information management.    Some specific examples of course design are considered with particular reference to the interpretation by Australian associations.
