A growing body of research about personal epistemological beliefs has provided tertiary educators with evidence to inform strategies in  promoting effective teaching and learning. Personal epistemological beliefs refer to an individualâ€™s beliefs about the nature of knowing and knowledge and are considered to influence how one engages in teaching and learning experiences. There has been very little research, to date, that has explored how pre-service teacher education studentsâ€™ beliefs change over time and identified factors associated with such changes. No research exists in the area of early childhood teacher education. This paper uses current literature on the development of epistemological beliefs to provide a conceptual framework on which to base intervention for early childhood pre-service teacher education students.  It is focused on providing a constructivist approach to knowledge through personal engagement and authentic experiences.
