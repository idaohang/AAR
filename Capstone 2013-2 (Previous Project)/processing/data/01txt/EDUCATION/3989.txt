This paper draws on practical experience in the development and implementation of an integrated learning environment (ILE) that allows teachers to take advantage of improved connectivity to use the web as a medium for teaching and learning activities in Hong Kong primary schools. It explores the critical issues of implementation, the ingredients needed for creating an infrastructure to support a rich mix of learning to facilitate an active learning community involving school administrators, teachers, students and parents and school culture change in adopting a new paradigm.
