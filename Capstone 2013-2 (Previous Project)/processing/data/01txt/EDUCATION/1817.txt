Over time, the Meanjin local council of ALEA, has been running a series of Key Teacher inservice days for teachers in the Brisbane and Ipswich area, and more recently further north in Yandina for Sunshine Coast teachers.  Teachers who are ALEA members or whose schools are institutional members are able to attend up to three of these inservice days each year for a nominal cost.  In the first part of this article Beryl Exley reviews the sessions presented on Friday 17 October, 2003 at Ipswich, a region mentored by ALEA Queensland State President, Nikki King.  The sessions all dealt with the theme of connecting communities and contextualising literacies.  In the second part Sandra Wright, a key teacher at Hatton Vale State School, details the experiences of her schoolâ€™s attempt to connect with its community and to contextualise childrenâ€™s multiple literacies.
