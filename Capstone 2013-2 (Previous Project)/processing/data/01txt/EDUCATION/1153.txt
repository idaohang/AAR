Literature at national and international levels argues the importance of including mental computation in a mathematics curriculum that promotes number sense.  Characteristics of good mental computers have been documented.  However, there is conflicting evidence about what constitutes high performance in mental computation â€“ high accuracy as a result of efficient mental strategies and number sense or high accuracy without accompanying number sense.  The purpose of this paper is to present findings of a study that investigated accurate mental computers and the factors that supported accuracy.
