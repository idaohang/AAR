Curriculum differentiation is an important strategy that acknowledges the need to provide appropriately challenging learning experiences for all children. Both high ability students and those with learning difficulties require pedagogical practices that specifically meet their needs. Vertical timetabling is one approach to restructuring curricula commonly found in secondary schools, which allows students to engage in challenging learning experiences appropriate for their ability levels.  The approach is predicated on student choice and appropriate content. This chapter reports on a teacher-led action research project at &quot;Learning Place&quot; which involved developing, trialling and implementing vertically timetabled mathematics lessons in Year 4 over a six-month period. A vertically timetabled approach was seen as an opportunity by the teachers concerned to provide appropriate learning experiences to three distinct cohorts of learnersâ€”exceptional students, competent students, and those who were struggling with the core work. Participantsâ€™ reflections on the project, their perceptions of childrenâ€™s academic achievements and their honest self-appraisals were sourced in interviews and provide data. These data indicate that the successful implementation of vertical timetabling was facilitated by participantsâ€™ desires to lead the intervention, to work collaboratively in planning, teaching and resource sharing, and to critically reflect on their own practice as a teaching team.
