This study used focus groups to investigate 18 general classroom teachers' and 12 learning support teachers' conceptions of the attributes of successful learning support teachers. Based on the attributes emerging from the focus groups, a 20-item questionnaire was designed consisting of statements in four categories: Knowledge and Experience; Organisational Skills; Communication; and Personal Traits. The questionnaire was completed by 117 teachers. Results indicated that there was agreement between the focus groups and teachers who responded to the questionnaire. However, there was a mismatch between learning support teachers and classroom teachers as to what they regarded as being the most important attributes. Learning support teachers indicated that Knowledge and Experience was the most important attribute but this same category was not rated as highly by general classroom teachers. In the total sample of teachers, Personal Traits was rated significantly higher than the other three categories. Communication was ranked second which was significantly higher than Organisational Skills.
