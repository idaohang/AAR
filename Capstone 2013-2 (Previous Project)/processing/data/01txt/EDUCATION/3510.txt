Language programs in Australian universities are hiring more and more sessional  staff employed on a casual basis to assume the teaching of foreign language  courses. Sessional staff include postgraduate students and external staff hired  on an hourly basis to teach a specific course. This increase in the number of  sessional staff raises the question of their training. Even though some sessional  staff are highly qualified and have previous classroom experience, most are at an  early stage in their careers and need some help to carry out their language  teaching duties efficiently. This paper will report on the initial, exploratory phase  of a project aimed at developing a model for the training of sessional staff  involved in the teaching of French courses at the University of Queensland. The  report will show how contextual constraints such as time and the absence of a  formal contract were overcome by introducing an in-service model of teacher  training. The main features of the model include the focus on one area of  teaching practice, error correction, which has been the object of extensive  research in the field of Applied Linguistics, and the use of an action research  approach to teacher professional development. The paper will conclude with a  discussion on the future of the model. The use of action research combined with  the application of findings from academic research may be regarded as  innovative aspects of the model. However, further development of this  professional in-service training model is very much dependent on the availability  of funds to finance mentoring and sessional staff seminars.
