At Queensland University of Technology (QUT, Australia), in the Bachelor of Education (Early Childhood), Technical and Further Education (TAFE) students (with a Diploma) enrol with Advanced Standing (one yearâ€™s credit).  These students share many challenges faced by first year university students â€“ workload, technology, academic orientation and application.  They also experience feelings of isolation and uncertainty in dealing with the â€œuniversity cultureâ€¿ (Cantwell &amp; Scevak, 2004; Dickson, 2000).  Often, they do not perform as well academically and their attrition rates are higher than those for first year students and the remainder of the BEd (EC) cohort (Strategic Information &amp; Analysis Division of Finance, Resources, Planning, QUT, 2003).  This project addresses issues facing these students in their transition to University by developing an integrated and contextualised mentoring program designed specifically for their needs.  Nine Early Childhood third and fourth year students were enlisted as mentors to groups of approximately six transition TAFE students.  In this paper we discuss the dynamics of the mentoring scheme and future directions for mentoring projects within the BEd (EC).
