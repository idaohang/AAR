Qualitative research methods were used to conduct case studies of two secondary schools in Australia, focusing on the provision of support for students with different learning needs. Interview data were used to report differences in collective beliefs, values and descriptions of school practice that foster two contrasting school cultures. One of these school cultures is described as more inclusive and the other as more traditional. The study used an inductive approach to analysing interview data to reveal differences between the schools using three main categories: (1) model of support and the role of the special educator; (2) student focused or content-focused culture; and (3) beliefs and attitudes relating to inclusive schoolÂ¬ing and teacher responsibility for catering for diverse learning needs. The findings of this study have implications for development of inclusive schooling.
