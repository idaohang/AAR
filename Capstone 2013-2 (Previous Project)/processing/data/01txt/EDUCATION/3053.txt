Changes in our concepts of work and career reflect a move from an industrial era to what has been termed a postindustrial, information or postmodern era, an era wherein our concepts of career guidance also need to change. A number of authors have commented on aspects of career guidance practice which need to incorporate changes, such as career education and career counselling (Guichard, 2001; McMahon &amp; Patton, 2000; Watts, 2001). This paper will add to the call for greater application of constructivist approaches to career education. It will critique current practices and present strategies which reflect such approaches.
