Children with deficits of higher mental function are often referred to paediatricians and child neurologists.  The referrals may occur for the specific evaluation of a childâ€™s school difficulties or because of a symptom, such as school refusal, headache or deterioration in behaviour.  It is generally accepted that examination of the higher mental abilities could be a routine part of a complete neurological examination in any child presenting with such problems.  Despite this, there is very little information concerning normal values for screening tests of higher mental function at different ages in childhood.
