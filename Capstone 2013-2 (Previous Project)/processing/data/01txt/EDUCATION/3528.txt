Roberts and Nason (2003) found that teams within a CSCL environment balanced by Team Role Preference (TMP) produced better quality knowledge building than non-balanced teams. This study extended the work of Roberts and Nason by investigating the interaction patterns of the balanced and non-balanced teamsâ€™ on-line discussion forum discourse utilising the Poole and Holmes (1995) Functional Category System (FSC). This study found that although the non-balanced teams engaged in more interactions than the balanced teams, quantity of interaction did not equate with quality of interaction; the balanced teams demonstrated more efficient and effective knowledge building interactions than non-balanced teams. These findings indicate that CSCL researchers need to focus not only on the quantity but also on the quality of interactions when designing social infrastructures within CSCL environments.
