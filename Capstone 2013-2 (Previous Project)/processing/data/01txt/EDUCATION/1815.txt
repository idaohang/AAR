This paper is concerned with Australian educatorsâ€™ experiences of teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Central Java, Indonesia.  Data were collected from private English language colleges in Jakarta, Central Java, via an interview study with educators who identified as Australian citizens.  Employing an analytical framework derived mainly from the work of Basil Bernstein, the paper examines educatorsâ€™ accounts of what is validated as curriculum and how the pedagogic relationship is structured within this offshore context.  Moreover, this study reveals how much control the educator and the learner have over the curriculum and the pedagogic relationship, thus raising questions about the space created for cultural difference.
