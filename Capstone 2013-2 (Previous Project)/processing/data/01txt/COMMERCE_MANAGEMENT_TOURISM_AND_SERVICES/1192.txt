This paper examines prospects for small scale farm foresters in terms of marketing factors that are influenced by the industrial plantations of timber in Australia and responses available to small scale forestry. Factors that promote the prospects of lesser used and lesser known species are used to evaluate market prospects for north Queensland timber. Market prospects are identified and the importance of end user requirements in achieving these is demonstrated by examples of successful market approaches to sales of Australian sourced timber.
