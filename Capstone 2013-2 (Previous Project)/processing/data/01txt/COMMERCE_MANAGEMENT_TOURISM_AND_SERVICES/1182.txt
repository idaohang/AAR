The study of country of origin effect (COOE) examines how consumers perceive products emanating from a particular country.  In this paper, we propose a model of Champagne purchase decision variables that places COOE as secondary to situational purchase context.  Our model uses Australian â€˜aspirational drinkersâ€™ and we propose situational purchase context is the primary decision driver (variable 1) in this purchase decision.  We believe that if the occasion is special, the consumer will be motivated by country of origin effect (variable 2) to buy Champagne, and willing to spend a considerable sum of money (variable 3).  Together these variables determine perceptions of prestige and luxury (4); comprised of brand image (4a), product presentation (4b) and taste (4c).  Each of these variables is discussed with the envisaged choice outcome understood as a brand of Champagne purchased.  Areas for future research are also outlined.
