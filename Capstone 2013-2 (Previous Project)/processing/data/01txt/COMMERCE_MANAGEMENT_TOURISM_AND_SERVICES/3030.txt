We propose that two forms of &quot;a hard life&quot; will have divergent effects on creativity. The first, workplace distress, is hypothesised to be negatively related to creativity; however the second, work demands, is hypothesised to be positively related. Two studies were conducted: The first was a cross-sectional study of 1180 hospital employees in the UK, and the second was a longitudinal study of 300 public sector employees in Australia. These two studies, each with different samples and different operationalisations, generated substantively similar results. Despite a high correlation between the two forms, an increase in workplace distress led to a decrease in employee creativity, but an increase in work demands led to an increase in creativity. These findings held up not just cross-sectionally, but also longitudinally, providing additional credence to the results. Potential mediators and interactive effects were assessed, and theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
