This study examined the relationship between employeesâ€™ individualism-collectivism (I-C) orientation and attitudes towards, and uptake of, training and development activity. A survey of 191 manufacturing employees ascertained their I-C orientation, preferences for development activity, and actual participation behaviour in development activities. The results showed that the greater the collectivistic orientation of an employee, the more they preferred activities that emphasised group skills. A preference for development activities that emphasised personal skills, however, was not related to I-C orientation. Collectivists participated more in activities that emphasised group skills than activities emphasising individual skills, while individualists showed the opposite trend. Implications, both theoretical and practical, are discussed.
