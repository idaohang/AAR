A comparison of Aucklandâ€™s American Express Viaduct Harbour and the southern suburb of Otahuhu yields a compelling illustration of the paradoxes and complexities of globalisation.  On one hand, the American Express Viaduct Harbour, home until very recently to the Americaâ€™s Cup fleet, is a product of global economic excess. The harbour is a playground for business and aristocratic elites (and those wishing to bask in reflective glory) who conspicuously consume (Veblen 1994) global super brands. On the other hand, the southern suburb of Otahuhu, depicted in the film Once Were Warriors, represents a very different image of globalisation, one typified by economic hardship, unemployment, and mass migration. However, simple responses of these two very different spaces do not produce a complete picture. This article has been constructed through images of the Viaduct Harbour and Otahuhu observed during the lead up competition to the Americaâ€™s Cup, the Louis Vuitton cup, in January 2003.  By reviewing the contradictions and paradoxes on these two areas of Auckland we can better appreciate the complex and intricate influence of global forces that are rarely clear, simple, or easily definable (Urry 2003).
