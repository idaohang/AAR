This paper examines requirements for entry into international timber markets such as export specifications, logistics and timber labelling It investigates methods for family-farm enterprises to become involved in the international trade of timber. Small-scale farm enterprises would benefit from exposure to larger markets for their timber. They would experience more stable demand markets from a larger consumer base and obtain rates of return that might provide more adequate compensation for their efforts. At present the choice of farm forest species planted is more likely to be based on local demand factors, local knowledge and environmental factors without consideration for potential sales in wider markets. This paper argues that exposure to international trade can create an impetus for change that would be beneficial for the small-scale forest sector.
