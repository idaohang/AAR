This paper looks at the degree of harmonisation of food labelling regulations between Germany as a member of the EU and Australia as a member of FSANZ. A qualitative review of secondary data was undertaken to identify similarities and differences between the labelling regulations of these countries from a regulatory perspective. This research found that there are still differences between Germany and Australia in their food labelling regulations but suggests that regulations will become more and more similar between these countries and within the trade blocks due to increasing trade with each other.
