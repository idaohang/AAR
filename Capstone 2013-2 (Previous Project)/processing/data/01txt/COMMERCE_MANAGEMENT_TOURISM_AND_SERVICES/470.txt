Despite over a decade of talks on reform, agriculture remains the most highly subsidised sector in the world economy.  The aim in this paper is to consider international agricultural trade reform. A review of the literature on international agricultural trade reform reveals several dominant themes.  The first concerns the influences of national interests, both domestically and internationally.  The domestic positions of the USA and the EU are seen by many to dominate international policy.  A second theme centres on the argument that trade reform is good.  This position is highly contested in the literature and policy debates with both sides appearing strongly supported. A third theme is the prospects for further trade reform and international negotiations.  How the Uruguay Round has advanced, or failed to advance, international trade is one issue.  Subsequently, examining the future of Doha and other negotiations post Cancun raises important issues about multilateral, bilateral and other approaches.
