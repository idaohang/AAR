This study examines the content of concise reports in Australia to ascertain whether deficiencies identified by ASIC in 1999 have been rectified. Second, the concise reports are compared with the full financial report to establish if the presence of a concise report has in any way altered the full financial report. Third, the discussion and analysis (D&amp;A)section required in the concise reports is examined to provide descriptive evidence on its content. Although several shortcomings identified by ASIC in concise reports for 1999 have been resolved for 2000, role confusion surrounds the concise and full financial reports. It appears that, for many companies, AASB 1039 has resulted in the concise report becoming the full financial report.
