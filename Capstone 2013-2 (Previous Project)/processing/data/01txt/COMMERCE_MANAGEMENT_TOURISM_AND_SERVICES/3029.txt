This research examined the influence of a personâ€™s age and their attitudes towards ageing in their placement of age parameters, and in particular, their placement of the beginning of old age. Previous research has shown that as an individualâ€™s age increases, their parameter for the beginning of old age is placed further along the lifespan. Two groups (young and middle-aged adults) were recruited to test the hypothesis that an individualâ€™s attitude towards old age will mediate the relationship between age and the placement of this age parameter, such that the middle-aged group will hold more negative attitudes towards old age causing them to place the parameter further away. Results showed that middle-aged adults were, in fact, more optimistic towards old age than young adults. Despite this unanticipated finding, the mediation model was tested and found to be valid. Thus, middle-aged people were more optimistic towards old age and this caused them to place the age parameter further down the lifespan. Two possible explanations were suggested: an increase in contact with counterstereotypical older adults, and a possible confounding effect of optimism towards living a long life. Policy implications were discussed.
