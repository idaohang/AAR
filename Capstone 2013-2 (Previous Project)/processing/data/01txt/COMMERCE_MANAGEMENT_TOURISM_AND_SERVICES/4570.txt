Each year QUTâ€™s Centre of Philanthropy and Nonprofit Studies collects and analyses statistics on the amount and extent of tax-deductible donations made and claimed by Australians in their individual income tax returns to deductible gift recipients (DGRs). The information presented in this working paper is based on the amount and type of tax-deductible donations made and claimed by Australian individual taxpayers to DGRs for the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004.     This information has been extracted mainly from the Australian Taxation Office's publication Taxation Statistics 2003-04. The 2004 report is the latest report that has been made publicly available. It represents information in tax returns for the 2003-2004 year processed by the ATO as at 31 October 2005. This year we have also been able to divide tax deductible donations by gender based on the ATO statistics.
