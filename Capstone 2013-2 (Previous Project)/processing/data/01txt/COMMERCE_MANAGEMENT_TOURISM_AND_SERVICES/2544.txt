This paper examines the role of student characteristics, personality, and perceptions of the banking and finance profession in determining the choice of an undergraduate finance major. The data employed is drawn from a survey of first-year business students at a large Australian university. Student characteristics examined include gender, secondary school studies in accounting, business and economics, grade point average and attendance mode. Perceptions of the banking and finance profession revolve around questions of overall interest, relationships of persons working within the profession, the manner in which the profession deals with problems and tasks, and the nature of these problems. A binary probit model is used to identify the source and magnitude of factors associated with a studentâ€™s choice of major. The evidence provided suggests that the choice of a finance major is a function of studentsâ€™ overall interest in the profession, perceptions of how the profession deals with problems and tasks, the nature of these problems and tasks, mode of attendance and, to a lesser extent, gender. The study emphasises the need to incorporate factors associated with studentsâ€™ personality and perceptions in analyses of this type.
