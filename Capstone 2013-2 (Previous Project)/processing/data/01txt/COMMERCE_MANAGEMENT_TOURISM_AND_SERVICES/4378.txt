Early research in entrepreneurship is characterised by a neglect of female entrepreneurs (Buttner &amp; Moore, 1997) and a gender neutral approach (Baker, Aldrich &amp; Liou, 1997). Today, the growing number of female entrepreneurs around the world (OECD, 2000) appears to be accompanied by an increase in published studies of the phenomenon. Here three of these manuscripts are reviewed, plus a fourth volume devoted to key concepts in gender studies.
