This paper discusses the changes in markets that have been created by the adoption of modern logistics practices and supply chain management by commercial businesses and their potential impact on small-scale farm forestry. Through the use of regional examples and discussion of relevant issues to illustrate these impacts, an evaluation of the involvement and potential benefits and costs for small-scale forestry businesses is investigated. The paper then assesses the likely future implications for family businesses in markets influenced by the adoption of these practices. The conclusion reached is that involvement in logistics practices is as relevant to small-scale foresters as to any other forestry group.
