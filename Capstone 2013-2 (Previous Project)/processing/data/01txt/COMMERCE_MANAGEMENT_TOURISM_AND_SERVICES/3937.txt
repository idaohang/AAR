Queensland Department of Housing has proposed the use of partnerships as one possible option to deliver affordable housing outcomes.  Although this initiative is supported by other stakeholders, many constraints have impeded its implementation for the delivery of real projects.  Whilst it might find application for mixed housing projects with some relaxation on tax and/ or planning requirements, in general, affordable housing has not been seen as a valuable investment.  Moreover, the partnerships require stakeholders to work across boundaries and outside their comfort zones.    This initial study examines the use of soft systems framework to explore stakeholdersâ€™ views of multi-stakeholder partnerships in affordable rental housing.  A series of in-depth interviews with major stakeholders representing housing providers, regulators and users in Queensland has been conducted.      Soft systems methodology has been used to express the unstructured problem by using systematic thinking to develop a conceptual model to solve the problem.  A complex problem is broken down into role, social system and political system analyses.  This study provides an example of using systematic thinking in solving conflicting problems.  The gap between the conceptual model and implementation in the real world situation was also investigated.   Major changes in the socio-cultural aspects of the broader community as well as between stakeholders were required to implement the further development of  multi-stakeholder partnerships for affordable rental housing.
