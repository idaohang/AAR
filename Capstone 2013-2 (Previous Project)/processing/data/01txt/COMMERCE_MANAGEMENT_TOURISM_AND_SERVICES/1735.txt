This paper constructs a model for small business learning based on resent research in Australia and Scotland. The model is based on seven steps - the engagement decision, formulating goals, approximation of task, seeking support, expertise and improvement through practice, increased confidence and ability and, finally, a progression to a new engagement decision. The paper suggests that the model presents a natural flow of learning and, as such, could prove a useful model for learning within any small group.
