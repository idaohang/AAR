This study develops an internal control evaluation (ICE) model - a prototype matrix model -which addresses limitations noted in previous studies. 94 auditors from 5 firms evaluated the internal control structure of a fictitious entity using their current firm methodology and the ICE model, and compared methods. For &quot;overall usefulness&quot; and three factors, &quot;cost&quot;; &quot;logical development&quot;; and &quot;time to complete&quot;, auditors ranked the ICE model as good as current evaluation methods. For one factor &quot;completeness&quot;, two firms considered it less beneficial. Results indicate attempts to develop a standardised evaluation model are worthwhile. Such a model may benefit the auditing profession, as standardisation may support the stance for self-regulation.
