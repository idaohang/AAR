The challenge for boards is to prevent crises in the organisations they govern. Performance evaluation is a key means by which boards can recognise and correct corporate governance problems and add real value to their organisations.  Our paper provides a practical introduction to board and director evaluations. We discuss the reasons for governance failures and how board evaluations can help prevent them from occurring.  We then review the performance pressures facing boards and the benefits of board evaluations in meeting these pressures.  Finally, we introduce our framework for a successful board and/or individual director evaluation, whatever the company type.  In this framework, we suggest there are seven key questions to consider when planning a board evaluation and discuss each of these seven decision areas.
