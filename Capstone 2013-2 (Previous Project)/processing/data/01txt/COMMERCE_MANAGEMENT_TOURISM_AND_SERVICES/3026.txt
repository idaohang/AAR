We identify the creative requirement of a job as a neglected predictor of employee creativity and propose that it may account for relationships between traditional work factors and creativity. As such, it may represent a more effective means of increasing creativity than changes in job design. Using structural equation modeling, we tested this model against four competing models, using a sample of 1083 health service employees. Creative requirement was found to account for much of the variance by fully mediating the effects of supportive leadership and role requirements and partially mediating those of empowerment and time demands. We conclude that creative requirement is an important proximal determinant of employee creativity and a potentially significant intervention.
