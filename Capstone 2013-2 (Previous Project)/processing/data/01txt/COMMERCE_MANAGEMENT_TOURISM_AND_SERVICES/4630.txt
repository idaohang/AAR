Increasing demand for road freight has lead to a greater adoption of more-productive multi-combination vehicles on roads that are generally also used as major arterial corridors for non-freight traffic. This paper reports on a study into the effects that these vehicles, such as B-doubles, have on the traffic performance of urban traffic corridors and offers a number of strategies having the potential to minimize their impacts.  A computer-based microsimulation traffic model was created of a multi-lane arterial corridor, including coordinated traffic signals. Individual vehicles progressed along the corridor, with each vehicle following its leader and changing lanes when advantageous and safe to do so. The longitudinal vehicle dynamic behavior of each vehicle was modeled in detail, with heavy vehicles accelerating at a lower rate that light vehicles. The model was calibrated with data collected from GPS-equipped chase car surveys conducted on an urban corridor in Brisbane, Australia. Corridor performance was reported in terms of intersection capacity and delays as well as travel speeds and stop rates for each vehicle type.  The performance of the corridor was found to be sensitive to traffic control measures including the speed limit and traffic signal controller settings such as cycle time and progression design speed. A range of freight policy scenarios were examined, including the effects of increasing freight volumes, freight vehicle mode choice, and vehicle type-specific lane restrictions. Some policies having the potential to improve corridor traffic performance and freight efficiency were able to be identified. Advance detection of heavy vehicles approaching a traffic signal and extension of the green signal until their passage was found to offer benefits to all vehicles on the corridor.
