Alliances are an interorganizational phenomenon which utilise information processing activities.  The social capital of individual alliance partners influences the amount of information processing activities in terms of information acquired, information disseminated and behaviour responsiveness.  This paper examines how learning occurs in alliances through sharing information between alliance partners.  Propositions are identified which discuss how social capital relates to information processing activities in an alliance setting.  Suggestions for future research are identified that highlight the infancy of the literature on linking alliance and social capital theory together.
