The overriding reason why people work in teams is because they share a common goal or purpose which they believe will be achieved more successfully by working together. This notion of shared purpose or shared vision is the defining element of teams at work. By taking the time to clearly define team vision, purpose and objectives, those who work within teams have a greater chance of being effective and creative in their work.
