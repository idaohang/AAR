To date there is much disagreement about the meaning of phenomenology possibly because the term has been used so widely. For instance, phenomenology has been conceptualised as a philosophy, a research method and an overarching perspective from which all qualitative research is sourced.  The aim of this paper is it endeavours to make phenomenology more accessible and in turn a more attractive research methodology to use in management related research. The paper begins by exploring some of the well-known versions of phenomenological philosophy emanating from its founding father, Edmund Husserl. It then explores phenomenology as a research approach. Here two well-known applications of phenomenology are compared and contrasted to show some of the different assumptions underpinning these approaches. The paper makes the claim that phenomenological research methodology, while relatively unused in management research, has much to offer.
