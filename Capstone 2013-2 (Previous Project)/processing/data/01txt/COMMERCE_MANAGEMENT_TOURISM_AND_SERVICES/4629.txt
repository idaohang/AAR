Non-profit organisations are major providers of services in many fields and often receive financial support from government. This paper investigates a number of different forms of government/non-profit relationships, with the viewpoint being mainly, though not exclusively, from the perspective of the non-profit agencies. Research methods included collecting primary data from peak agencies, service providers and government staff; and gathering secondary data from government and the agencies connected with the specific funding programs.  Two programs were selected for further examination and became case studies in order to identify the elements of what makes a successful funding program.     Three typologies of government/non-profit relations were identified as relevant.  An analysis of the models shows that, while they provide an excellent springboard for the process of typifying government/non-profit relationships, there are inconsistencies when the models are compared with one another.  In particular, none of the models allows for a comparison of relationships across a number of variables such as those of values, power and objectives.  In view of this, a new model is proposed and explained, which builds on previous models and provides a means for the advancement of government/non-profit relationships.  The model may prove useful in analysing the current condition of relationships between non-profit agencies and government departments.
