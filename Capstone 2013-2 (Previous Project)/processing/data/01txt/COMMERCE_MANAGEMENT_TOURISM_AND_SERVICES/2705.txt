A sample of thirty listed Australian gold producers is used to compare the financial performance measures provided by accounting-based financial  ratios, and production performance as measured by efficiency indices. The results indicate that simple ratios are unlikely to provide efficiency rankings similar to those obtained from multiple-input, multiple-output methodologies. However, whilst the two methods can disagree substantially on the relative performance of individual decision-making units, when used jointly the results can offer valuable insights into the concept of firm performance.
