Trade influences regional development.  This occurs in a variety of ways, some of which are examined in this paper.  Both involve big ideas, which can be conflicting.  Unbalanced development that may attend trade can persist, fashioning regions and the lives of their peoples for generations.  The Northern Territory is but one example.         Trade impacts is an area where much is asserted but relatively little is actually known.  For some trade is always good, as is growth, particularly of exports and notably in agriculture.  Beyond such simplistic thinking a range of methods may be used to indicate the impacts of trade.        Better understanding of trade impacts and strategies is needed. Trade can be beneficial, but it need not be.  The USA Australia preferential trade agreement and international agricultural trade reform provide examples. Better is needed for compatible, sustainable development of regions in Australia, and in the wider world.
