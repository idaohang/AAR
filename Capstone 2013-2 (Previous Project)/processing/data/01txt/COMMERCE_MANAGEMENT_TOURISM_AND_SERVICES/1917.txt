This paper describes the design and development of a CD ROM intended to assist students' learning by bringing a sense of reality to the concepts studied in relation to Accounting Information Systems cycles. The educational design is underpinned by constructivist theories of learning which espouse the benefits of experiential learning in facilitating effective student learning. Three Australian companies - Warner Bros. Movie World, Golden Circle and Zupps Parts â€“ are featured on the CD ROM to provide virtual 'experiential learning experiences' for students.   An extensive evaluation of the CD ROM was conducted, involving both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, to ascertain students' perceived value of the CD ROM in assisting their learning. Results indicate that the CD ROM offered students a real life understanding of applicable concepts and that students were receptive to learning in online environments which are appropriately designed and constructed.
