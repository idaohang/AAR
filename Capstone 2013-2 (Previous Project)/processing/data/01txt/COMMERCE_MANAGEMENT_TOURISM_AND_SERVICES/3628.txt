This research examines the roles that an entrepreneurs dispositions to interpersonal trust, and vigilance play in the process of opportunity recognition.  An entrepreneurs use of social networks as a resource in opportunity recognition is also examined.  The basis of this investigation was an empirical study of information and communication technology (ICT) entrepreneurs in Queensland, Australia.  A series of twelve hypotheses were developed and tested in this research.  Despite a modest sample size support was found for six of the hypothesised relationships.  An entrepreneurs disposition to both trust and vigilance were found effect the outcomes of their opportunity identification behaviours.  A disposition to excess vigilance inhibited the development of entrepreneurial opportunities.  While, an extended social network and a trusting disposition were seen to facilitate the development of entrepreneurial opportunities.
