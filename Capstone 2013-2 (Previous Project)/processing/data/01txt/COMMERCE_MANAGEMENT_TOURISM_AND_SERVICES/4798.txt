An exploratory and descriptive case study was conducted to discover knowledge management issues and practices in the Australian branch of an international professional services provider referred to as IPSF. Though the study has an operational emphasis, both macro and micro issues of knowledge management are considered; macro issues pertain to the creation of knowledge assets, while micro issues pertain to access, transfer and reuse of knowledge within the firm, and between the firm and its clients. The study takes a professional services provider-centric view. The data was gathered from interviews with IPSF staff. Interpretation focuses on gaps between the literature and observed practice.
