Internal control evaluation is a crucial component of the external audit process. This study investigates what practicing auditors consider to be good methods of internal control evaluation. It then compares these to the current Australian auditing standard (AUS 402). A review of audit methodologies of three of Australiaâ€™s largest firms, and interviews with five audit experts were conducted. The results demonstrated a shift towards a â€˜business riskâ€™ approach as opposed to the former â€˜systems basedâ€™ approach to internal control evaluation. AUS 402 does not always reflect the modern practice, particularly in relation to the significance of individual elements of internal control and may be in need of revision, if professional pronouncements are to be viewed as in line with practice.
