The IT consulting process can be usefully examined through a knowledge management lens from multiple perspectives and levels. Knowledge transfer is crucial for successful consultant engagement and depends upon the conditions of client understanding and client involvement which need to be considered by both provider and purchaser of the service. The example of Enterprise Systems services shows the need for consultants to leverage knowledge for comparative advantage based in knowledge management strategy. Clients require a lifecycle-wide knowledge sourcing strategy, which is often effectively mediated by consultants. The study aims to combine these multiple levels and perspectives through integrative theory.
