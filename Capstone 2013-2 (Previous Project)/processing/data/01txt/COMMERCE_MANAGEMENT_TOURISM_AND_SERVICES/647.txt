In the latter part of the twentieth century a number of farm and rural womenâ€™s networks were established throughout Australia. One of the reasons why such groups were established was to address the paucity of women in leadership positions in mainstream agri-political groups. This paper explores how men in male dominated agri-political groups have responded to this gender equity strategy. Using data from a doctoral study examining women's participation in the Australian sugar industry I examine the discourses within which men in the mainstream agri-political group, CANEGROWERS, have positioned womenâ€™s networks and the women involved in networks. These are discourses which construct women involved in networks as lacking in femininity and which re-inscribe normative definitions of femininity and masculinity in agriculture. These, it is argued, act in powerful ways to regulate and contain womenâ€™s involvement in agri-politics.
