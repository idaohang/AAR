Enterprise knowledge resides in people, in documents, and in the way that both the people and the documents are organised. Use of this knowledge can be enhanced by reflecting the enterprise in its document, records and information management. Consideration is given to factors that influence effective information management and utilisation. These include metadata, vocabulary control, information quality and ownership.
