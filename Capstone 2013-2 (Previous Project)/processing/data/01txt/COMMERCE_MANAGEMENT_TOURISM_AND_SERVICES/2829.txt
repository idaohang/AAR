In recent decades, mentoring has been identified, often uncritically, as an overwhelmingly positive workplace learning activity for men, women and minority groups in a variety of organisational settings such as schools, universities, hospitals, corporations, and government departments. This paper begins by exploring what is understood by mentoring, the functions it fulfils, and some of its benefits and hazards for the mentor, mentee (protÃ©gÃ©) and organisation. We then report on the findings of two meta-analytic like studies of mentoring. The first study draws upon 159 pieces of empirical research taken from the education literature. The second study draws on 151 pieces of empirical research taken from the business literature. The review of these two bodies of research is an attempt to clarify some of the significant outcomes of mentoring and to determine the extent to which a â€˜dark sideâ€™ of mentoring exists. The paper concludes with implications for practice.
