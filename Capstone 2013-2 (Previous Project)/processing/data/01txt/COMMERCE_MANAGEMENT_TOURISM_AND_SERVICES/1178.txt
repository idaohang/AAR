The current global business climate has seen a heightened awareness of the legal framework that surrounds corporations.  However, outcomes of legal decisions are not often evaluated as to their underlying economic rationale.  This paper seeks to contribute to this area by attempting to explain real property law in Australia, as evidenced by native title judicial decisions, through the application of an economic analysis of the law. In analysing these theories, the paper concludes that externalities and regulation were held to be an important component for economic agents within the real property law framework.
