Security is currently a key factor in the evolution of international trade, and maritime trade in particular, with a number of internationally mandated and voluntary initiatives underway focusing on vulnerabilities in supply and logistics chains. This paper suggests the combined effect of these initiatives, with suitable systems of risk management embedded in private and public sector groups within the industry may be more effective in mitigating the threat of maritime terrorism than with the initiatives alone.  The paper then draws on approaches to risk and crisis management in complex systems to examine options for integrating in-country and international frameworks.
