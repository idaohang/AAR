At the present time, Queensland is experiencing severe demand pressure on housing stock in the South-Eastern metropolitan region and in many regional and coastal centres.  Whilst median house prices are still well below Sydney and Melbourne, Australiaâ€™s third largest housing market is showing no signs of slowing in the current economic climate of low interest rates and stable levels of employment.  Despite the comparatively good affordability of the Queensland housing stock, access for low income and other disadvantaged and minority groups in the state is being eroded rapidly, partly by increased demand and partly by a loss of base level stock through renovation and redevelopment.    This paper will discuss the current situation regarding the stock of affordable housing by reference to current literature and pilot surveys of stakeholders in the public and private sector.  A particular focus of the paper will be a discussion of the expectations and limiting factors, nominated by supply side participants, in respects of the partnership arrangements which facilitate their involvement.
