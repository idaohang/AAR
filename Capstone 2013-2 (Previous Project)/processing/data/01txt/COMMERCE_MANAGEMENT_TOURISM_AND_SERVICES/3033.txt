Building on previous research that has generally focused on the innovation outcome, this study used inductive methods to investigate factors affecting engagement in the innovation process. Through 65 semi-structured interviews and 25 diary studies, I identified three types of demand that were interdependent and interacted to influence engagement. These were context demand (culture, motivation), project/role demand (innovation requirement, time resources, empowerment), and problem demand (problem type). The identification of these demands provide clear implications for managers who wish to increase employee innovation.
