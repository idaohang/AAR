Mode choice models developed thus far have not explicitly defined visitor mode choice and have therefore assumed that the mode choice characteristics of visitors are the same as residents.  In areas such as the Gold Coast, Australia, visitors account for over 20 percent of the total population and provide transit patronage levels equivalent to those of residents.  With an increasing emphasis on attracting higher transit mode shares, there is a need to understand the unique combination of factors which attract visitors to various types of transport during their stay.  This paper outlines the results of the first phase of a two-phase research programme involving surveys of visitors to calibrate visitor mode choice models.    The paper also deals specifically with bus priority treatments and their applicability to tourist areas. The current trends in bus priority treatments are addressed by considering a case study for the Gold Coast Highway located on Queenslandâ€™s Gold Coast. The Gold Coast is located approximately 100 km to the south of Brisbane which is the capital city of the State of Queensland.  This paper provides an evaluation of bus priority treatments and conditions for justification for such measures. The paper summarises the impact of introducing bus lanes, transit lanes, bus priority at traffic signals and improved ticketing systems for the Gold Coast Highway. The analysis indicates that journey time savings for buses of up to 20 percent may be achieved with these bus priority treatments.
