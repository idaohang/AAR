This paper establishes that the emergence of integrated manufacturing-service businesses is a key trademark of innovative industries and â€˜the new economyâ€™. Having established the benefits of such integration, the phenomenon is reviewed in relation to the Australian building and construction (B&amp;C) sector. It is hypothesised that manufacturers supplying building and construction work are adding value to their own activity, and that of the sector, by enhancing their product offerings via the provision of services. A small survey is undertaken, with the findings revealing the nature of service provision by manufacturers in the Australian B&amp;C sector. It appears that the â€˜bundlingâ€™ of products and services by these manufacturers is a key competitive strategy yielding significant benefits for them and the sector as a whole.
