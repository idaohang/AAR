Kelvin Grove Urban Village (KGUV) is a $400 million joint initiative of the Queensland Government and the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), delivered in association with the private sector.  It is located on 16Ha of land at the former Gona Army Barracks site, next to QUT-Kelvin Grove, and within 2km of the Brisbane CBD.  The development will incorporate around 800 residential units, QUT faculty buildings, shops, restaurants and cafes, all connected by parks and paths intended to promote walking and cycling.  The village includes infrastructure works such as new roads, underground services, parks and extensive landscaping.   One of the strategic goals of the KGUV Integrated Master Plan, August 2004 is to &quot;ensure that people using the urban village can be less car dependant than the general Brisbane population&quot;.  This reduction in car dependency requires not only the creation of active transport links within the urban village, but also the existence or creation of active transport links to the wider city within the KGUV Frame Area. The City West Strategy states that &quot;The highest priority is to ensure the Urban Village is fully connected to the rest of City West&quot;. The purpose of this project then is to:  â€¢	study and qualify regional accessibility to and from KGUV by active transport modes (walking, cycling, and public transport); and   â€¢	To identify proposals that will likely improve the regional transport systemâ€™s capability to provide for effective accessibility to KGUV by active transport.  A geographical information system (GIS) was the primary tool used for the analyses carried out in this study, and allowed the mapping of pedestrian, cycle, bus, train and ferry infrastructure, and the subsequent identification of where improvements may be made to the infrastructure network.  The GIS-based transport analysis software TLOS was used for the first time in Brisbane to integrate both temporal and spatial features of bus and train services into a single analysis.  The recommendations of this report for infrastructure improvements include:  â€¢	Upgrading of pedestrian access along the primary route to the CBD along Lower Clifton Terrace  â€¢	Upgrading of footpath infrastructure and signage along designated pedestrian and cycle routes between KGUV and the CBD  â€¢	Designation, marking and signage of any new sections of bikeway to improve connectivity with existing networks  â€¢	Consideration of redesignating some cycle routes away from streets that have steep grades or heavy traffic  â€¢	Signage on Kelvin Grove Road along the KGUV frontage directing pedestrians to cross at the signalised intersections at Blamey St and Musk Ave  â€¢	Signage within KGUV and along Kelvin Grove Road providing directional guidance to transit facilities, compatible with the TransLink information signage being installed across Brisbane  â€¢	Consideration of enhanced pedestrian priority at the signalised intersections on Kelvin Grove Road at Musk Ave and Blamey St, if feasible  â€¢	Widening and other upgrading of footpaths along both sides of Kelvin Grove Rd between Musgrave Road and Prospect Tce and along College Rd to accommodate shared pedestrian and bicycle traffic  â€¢	Consideration of installing pedestrian fencing along the eastern side of Kelvin Grove Rd between Musk Ave and Ithaca St exit ramp  â€¢	Redesign of traffic calming treatments on Victoria Park Road to provide for easier manoeuvring by bus operators, or alternatively, rerouting of the 391 service to avoid this section of road  â€¢	Consideration of extending the operation of the 391 service as KGUV develops, particularly during &quot;out of semester&quot; periods where services are currently reduced.
