Stated preference (SP) methods are widely used in travel behaviour research and are generally employed to identify behavioural responses of the people of the study area to the introduction of new travelling modes there. This paper presents a Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) instrument designed to identify the demand for new and faster bus services between Redland Shire and Brisbane City and that of environmental friendly modes, such as walking and cycling, for local trips within the Shire. The study will form an essential part of the Integrated Local Transport Plan (ILTP) developed by Redland Shire Council, which aims to reduce car dependency by enhancing the usage of alternative transport modes.
