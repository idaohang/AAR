This paper discusses the applications of agent-oriented techniques for modelling of the behaviour of a railway transportation system which consists of numerous interacting parties with different objectives, interests, autonomy, constraints, responsibilities and decision-making capabilities.  The agent model covers both business and operational aspects of the system and it enables possible connections to other modes of transportation and/or external monitoring bodies.  The multi-agent architecture required to match a real-world railway system will be presented and the additional functions and advantages brought by the agent model will also be explored.
