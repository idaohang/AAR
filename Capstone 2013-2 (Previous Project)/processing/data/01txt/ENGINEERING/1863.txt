Recently we have presented efficient structures for filters that produce an output with a single-bit resolution. As an application and extension of these works a baseband digital single-bit non-coherent Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK) demodulator is proposed.  This new structure contains no multi-bit multiplications unlike traditional methods of BFSK demodulation.  The single-bit BFSK demodulator is then simulated using an additive white Gaussian noise channel  As a benchmark the single-bit BFSK demodulator and the theoretical non-coherent BFSK demodulator bit errors are calculated and compared.
