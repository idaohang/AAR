This Working Paper reports on contract research commissioned by the Policy &amp; Planning Unit of the Traffic &amp; Transport Branch of the Brisbane City Council (BCC). In this report we identify likely determinants of demand for PT in the future, as well as the relative importance of the major factors influencing mode choice.     From a comprehensive set of influencing factors, the major determinants of PT mode share capture are identified based on past market research from Brisbane and elsewhere. Section 2 of the current report discusses the available evidence on the general attitudes to PT both in Brisbane and elsewhere. Section 3 presents a discussion of the main factors that have been found to affect PT mode choice. Finally, the most prominent influencing factors are prioritised in the context of future PT demand in Brisbane.
