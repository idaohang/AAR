Geographic Information Systems can offer rural land managers an improved means of capturing, storing analysing and communicating large quantities of varied information in a timely fashion. Land use planning seeks to promote reasonable and equitable patterns of growth to prevent resource depletion or degradation and to offer options for dirrent land use based on the physical capability of the land parcel. The efficient collection, interpretation and dissemination of land resource information for rural land users provides several important benefits.   This paper provides a brief explanation of research and the developed concepts involved in proposing a land boundary re-arrangement scheme. This paper also draws on recent expereinces in developing a small Geographic Information System in a rural landscape over a watershed catchment using a modern technogical approach.
