Bridges form a vital link in the physical infrastructure and must be maintained in &quot;safe working order&quot; at all times.  Unfortunately, many local and government departments have neglected the benefits of preventative maintenance and have opted for &quot;just in time&quot; repairs.  This is especially true for timber bridges.  This past neglect has placed bridge stock in a poor state that is only now being recognised as a significant problem.    A comprehensive research program is presently underway to address these concerns and to generate detailed knowledge on the load carrying capacities of timber bridges so as to manage the bridge stock efficiently. This research program incorporates destructive testing of timber bridge girders, load testing of timber bridges all of which will be supplemented by computer simulation. It will aim to determine the capacity of sniped (notched) timber bridge girders with regard to condition state, notch depth and gradient, location, size and type of defect; and material properties/species. It is believed that this research will enable asset managers to more accurately determine the capacity of sniped timber bridge girders to enable appropriate retrofitting and maintenance.  This paper will present some of the experimental destructive testing carried out on 53 timber girders in this research program and review and discuss the results.
