The Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) and the cross Wigner-Ville distribution (XWVD) are applied to signal detection and classification, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance is discussed. The method is applied to signaturing the individual cylinders of a diesel engine. A comparison with the short-time Fourier transform is provided
