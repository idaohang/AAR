Welcome to the first edition of The Queensland Surveyor for the year 2000.  I would assume most people have now almost recovered from the monumental celebrations that marked in the New Year. With the Olympic games being hosted in Australia later this year, we have chosen a gold coloured spine for all the 2000 editions. As this year progresses, I would strongly encourage you to GET and BE more involved in Surveying &amp; Mapping activities and opportunities. This is especially important as the new MGA94 Geocentric Datum is adopted and the spatial information industry is continuing its growth at a phenomenal rate.
