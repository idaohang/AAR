Traditional approaches to evolvable hardware (EHW), using a direct encoding, have not scaled well with increases in problem complexity. To overcome this there have been moves towards encoding a growth process, however there has not been a great deal of success with these. In this paper we present a morphogenetic EHW system that uses a variable length chromosome on which a gene expression model is encoded. We show that this is able to solve a signal routing problem, and scales well to larger, more complex, problems.
