The construction industry in the developing economy of Yemen is plagued by severe  problems that permeate most aspects of the industry from initial feasibility and design through to cost management and construction. Considerable capital and time is wasted within the construction process with a direct flow-on effect for the national economy. Further, the expected life-span of constructed facilities in Yemen is relatively short â€“ buildings often being redeveloped or requiring demolition due to poor design, questionable construction practices, or inappropriate material selection within few years. Despite the magnitude of the problems in the Yemen construction industry, virtually no research has been undertaken, and little data exists on the extent of the problem.
