Commencing Mid Year entry student numbers (Bachelor of Surveying program) were better than expected compared to previous years. Students entering via this mode undertake units in the summer semester time-frame and undertake a &quot;catch-up&quot; course structure up to the end of the fourth semester (including summer semester). The &quot;Open Up Your World&quot; surveying and mapping resources were utilized as part of the school of PLAS display along with examples of studentsâ€™ mapping and design assignments. Staff from the school of Planning, Landscape Architecture, and Surveying (PLAS) were involved in the very successful Courses and Careers day held on Sunday July 19th.
