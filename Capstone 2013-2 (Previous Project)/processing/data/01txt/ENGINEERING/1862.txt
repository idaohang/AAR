In this paper, we determine the expressions for the bit error rate (BER) performance and for the signal to interference ratio (SIR) of a direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system over the space-time hyperbolic channel for a macrocell environment.  A simplified expression based on the improved Gaussian approximation ratio (SEIGA) is used to evaluate the BER and the SIR for the DS-CDMA.  The performance of DS-CDMA over the hyperbolic channel model is examined in different propagation scenarios (i.e. urban scenario, shadowed urban and free-space scenarios), and with varying numbers of multi-path components.
