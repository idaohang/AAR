The teaching of undergraduate signal processing is inextricably bound up with the teaching of the related areas of Mathematics and Physics. Indeed, the first exposure of undergraduates to important signal processing concepts is often in Mathematics subjects. Since the first experiences in a particular area are often the most formative and lasting (the &quot;primacy regency&quot; principle), it is necessary to put in place mechanisms which guarantee the quality of not only the Signal Processing subjects, but also of the &quot;service subjects&quot;. One mechanism which can be used to enhance the quality of all relevant subjects is to have a regular public forum to review the teaching of all areas of the course, including the service subjects. This forum must include formal representation from students, who can report on their perceptions of the teaching quality, along with ways in which they feel improvements would be appropriate. It should also, ideally, include representation from teachers of the follow up courses and academics involved in research, who can provide feedback on demostrable student competencies. It is also desirable to have some type of measure of the development of nontechnical skills, such as the ability to work in teams, the ability to communicate, etc. The latter can be measured by regular student tests.
