Scheduling of trains on a single line involves using train priorities for the resolution of conflicts. The mathematical programming model described in the first part of this paper schedules trains over a single line track when the priority of each train in a conflict depends on an estimate of the remaining crossing and overtaking delay. This priority is used in a branch and bound procedure to allow the determination of optimal solutions quickly. This is demonstrated with the use of an example. Rail operations over a single line track require the existence of a set of sidings at which trains can cross and/ or overtake each other. Investment decisions on upgrading the number and location of these sidings can have a significant impact on both customer service and rail profitability. Sidings located at insufficient positions may lead to high operating costs and congestion. The second part of this paper puts forward a model to determine the optimal position of a set of sidings on a single track rail corridor. The sidings are positioned to minimise the total delay and train operating costs of a given cyclic train schedule. The key feature of the model is the allowance of non-constant train velocities and non-uniform departure times.
