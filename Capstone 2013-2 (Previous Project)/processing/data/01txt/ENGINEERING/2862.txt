With the rapid deployment of Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAVs) into new  applications, the pressure to extend the capabilities of current platforms is increasing.  Increased capabilities, however, should preferably not come at the cost of increased aircraft  size. In order to strive towards a more capable platform, the UAV must become increasingly  aware of its current state (control, navigation and health) and surroundings (location of  other aircraft, airspace boundaries, weather and terrain). This paper reports on the results  of research into providing a new level of situational awareness to the UAV that is low in cost  and complexity. In particular the paper investigates the unique benefits that can be obtained  from the integration of a GNSS sensor and a forward-looking vision sensor. The motivation  for this investigation is the belief that both GNSS and vision will be integral features of  future UAV avionics architectures: GNSS to provide basic aircraft navigation; and vision to  provide for obstacle, and aircraft collision avoidance. This paper will present results  showing that when single-antenna GNSS measurements are combined with information  derived from optical flow techniques, a number of unique synergies emerge. Sensor  accuracies and simulated flight control results are presented based on a comprehensive  MatlabÂ® SimulinkÂ® model which creates an optical flow stream based on the simulated flight  of an aircraft. The paper establishes the promise of this novel integrated GNSS/Vision  Sensor Suite approach for use as a complete UAV sensor package, or as a backup sensor for  an inertial navigation system.
