Rainfall-based flood estimation techniques are commonly adopted in hydrological design. Runoff routing models are widely used in Australia, which use either a linear or nonlinear storage-discharge relationship. Australian Rainfall and Runoff recommends the use of a nonlinear storage-discharge relationship; though, many have proposed other types of storage-discharge relationships. This paper adopts a Monte Carlo simulation technique to examine the effects of nonlinearity in storage-discharge relationship on design flood estimates. This simulates thousands of rainfall events, which are then routed through a runoff routing model to generate streamflow hydrographs. The nonlinearity parameter in the storage discharge relationship is varied to quantify its effects on design flood estimates. It is found that nonlinearity parameter has significant effect on design floods, particularly for larger floods. Results from three study catchments indicate that a nonlinear storage-discharge relationship is preferable to linear relationship.
