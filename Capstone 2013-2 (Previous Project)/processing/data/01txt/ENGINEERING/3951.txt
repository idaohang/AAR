3-D MODELLING at ANZAC PARK, Toowong has progressively developed from undertaking extensive and highly accurate field surveys using electronic total stations, GPS ground control and field data recorders.  The spatial data collected in the last few years for mapping purposes and student learning exercises utilises data in a three dimensional X,Y,Z coordinate referencing system. This spatial data management approach has lead to the creation of various digital terrain models. A range of software packages have been used to produce terrain representations and views of these digital models. Various data filters and synthesis of three dimensional information have been compiled to produce the various views. The images above demonstrate various model perspectives of the real-world terrain. These models can be of great assistance in visualization of existing facilities and for future planning developments.
