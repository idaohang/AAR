Although bagasse is used as a fibre source for paper manufacture throughout the world, no bagasse pulp industry exists in Australia.  The reasons for this include cost, given the enormous economics of scale achieved by the hardwood pulp mills, the remoteness of cane farms relative to hardwood pulp mills, and processing and environmental issues.  The processing issue arises because of the relatively poor drainage properties of bagasse pulp compared to wood pulp.  As paper machines are specifically designed to process wood pulp, they are not very effective to dewater bagasse pulp suspensions at an effective rate.  This reduces factory productivity and increases energy consumption, thereby impacting negatively on the overall operating costs of a pulp mill.    This paper describes an approach that would utilise surface chemistry and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to improve our understanding of bagasse pulp dewatering process.  This would lead to developing a process to enhance the physicochemical properties of bagasse fibres and hence the dewatering process.
