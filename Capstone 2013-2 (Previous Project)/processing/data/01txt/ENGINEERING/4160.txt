Recreational Geocaching is a new 21st century recreation and adventure game that came about as a result of the improving accuracy of electronic Global Positioning System (GPS) devices. With improved positional accuracy, of the order of five to ten metres, hand-held GPS's now allow unskilled users the ability to find geographic locations with precision and repeatability. With this new ability, people can now place geocaches in interesting places so that others can enjoy the challenge of finding them.     In the rapidly developing sport of Recreational Geocaching, the Internet is used as a medium for the distribution of geocache locations. Web-sites have now been set up to support this new activity. The Internet allows communication between the geocacher and those searching for the geocache. Posted on the Internet along with the geographic coordinates, are clues, pictures, and other information about the geocache.    This paper describes the recent history of recreational geocaching, some basic rules of the adventure game, some inclusions and exclusions of a cache, and adventure variations. An additional description of the survey methods used to confirm positional location and repeatability is included along with some surveying experiences around the SouthEast Queensland region.
