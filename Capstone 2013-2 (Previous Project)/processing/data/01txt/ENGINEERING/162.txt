The Joint Australian Engineering Satellite (JaeSat) is a micro satellite being developed under the management of the Australian Space Research Institute (ASRI). However, currently a project management responsibility transfer from ASRI to the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and a possible participation/cooperation from the Australian Cooperative Research Center (CRCSS) is under negotiation. JaeSat will be launched by a Ukraine rocket called Dnepr. The orbit will be a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with an altitude of 800 km and an inclination around 98 deg. This paper will provide information about the QUT GPS receiver design characteristics with respect to software and hardware. The testing environment will be presented, which includes a GPS signal simulator and in-house custom designed software.  Further, this paper will provide an outlook for future plans in order to implement additional features aiming for attitude determination based on GPS measurements.
