The combination of elements and conditions in inner-urban areas may be argued to constitute established patterns of urban sustainability. This paper develops the argument through a case study of the South Brisbane peninsula, one of Queenslandâ€™s oldest and densest inner-urban areas.  For the purposes of the paper, urban sustainability is defined in the context of urban design and development.  This definition highlights the interrelationship between urban form and structure, and the social and economic life of the city.  The paper argues that South Brisbane demonstrates significant characteristics of â€˜triple bottom lineâ€™ environmental, social and economic sustainability in a subtropical inner-urban context.  The main data source is a major study of Queenslandâ€™s cultural landscapes, supplemented by analysis and interpretation of current local government planning and community advocacy for sustainability.  The area is strongly supportive of sustainability in terms of residential densities; mixed land uses; coherent urban structure, with strong local centres serviceable by public transport; mixed building types and ages; diversity in culture and socioeconomic status of the population; and social capital in the form of engaged and creative communities.  The management of such diverse and dynamic inner-urban areas raises challenges for sustainable urban design and development practice.
