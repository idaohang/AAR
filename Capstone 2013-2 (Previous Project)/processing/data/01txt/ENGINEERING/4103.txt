The use of co-ordinates as a description of land boundaries and their limitations has been investigated given recent advances in GPS measurement technology and its proliferation in the surveying and mapping industry. While the use of coordinate information is in essence a representation of reality at a given point in time, it is shown that they can be used within a well-defined framework for summary purposes.   The conceptual and operational elements of a measurement-based spatial information system are developed in order to determine if it could aid in the organisation of land boundary information. The fundamental concepts of this information system are that measurements are the primary carriers of metric information. The investigation reveals that measurement-based concepts can serve as the foundation of a multi-purpose spatial information system. Increasing instrument precisions available to surveyors are providing quality measurements with decreasing uncertainties from standard daily operations. Much of this measurement information is in digital form and can provide useful additions of new information as and when they become available to the system. Control measurements are integrated into the system in the same manner as cadastral measurements. The addition of measurements increases the accuracy of the information system over time.
