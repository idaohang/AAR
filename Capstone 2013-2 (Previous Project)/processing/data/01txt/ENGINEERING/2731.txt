High occupancy vehicle (HOV) or transit lanes are seen as an option to increase person carrying capacity and improve travel times for users along congested road corridors.    Over the years RACQ has questioned the effectiveness of HOV lanes, especially in cases where a general purpose lane has been reallocated as a HOV lane.  In 2004, the Club awarded a scholarship to two QUT students to conduct their thesis on gaining a better understanding of HOV lanes.  The project covered a literature review of effectiveness measures for HOV lanes and field research analysing two road corridors in Brisbane - Waterworks Road and Lutwyche Road containing a T2 lane and T3 lane respectively.   Results show that even though HOV lanes may be highly effective in theory, they are questionable in reality.  The project assisted in developing an evaluation framework that RACQ hopes will be adopted by road authorities to use on HOV lanes now and in the future.
