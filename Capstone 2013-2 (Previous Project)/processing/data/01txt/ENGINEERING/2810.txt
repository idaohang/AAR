Traffic congestion in urban areas can be reduced through better management of road space. Micro-simulation is a fast emerging tool available to decision makers as an effective and economic way of evaluating alternative traffic management schemes without having to implement an on-site experiment. This paper presents a practical case study of applying VISSIM, one such micro-simulation program, for appraising various options of transport schemes to alleviate congestion in the UK. Three potential options were assessed for the A34/A4040 junction in Birmingham ranging from a low-cost solution to higher cost alternatives. Geometric data and traffic regulation orders, together with information on public transport operations and vehicle flows generated in the format of an origin-destination matrix based on Road Side Interviews (RSI) were incorporated into the model. The results showed that the base model is statistically validated according to British DMRB standards. The three options were analyzed were shown to yield reduced journey times, queuing, vehicleâ€“kilometres and delays.
