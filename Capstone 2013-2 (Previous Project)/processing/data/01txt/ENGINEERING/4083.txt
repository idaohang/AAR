First year students recently attended an interesting and stimulating field practical with the aim of improving their angle/direction determinant skills, problem solving skills, and to gain more real-world practical skills in utilizing a total station to solve for 2-D position from a four point resection challenge. Recently John Broadbent from Department of Transport, provided an informative guest lecture to the third year students on the national and state perspectives of hydrographic surveying and charting. Survey Practice Course students have just concluded the intensive contact mode at QUT.
