High-Speed Train (HST) operations have recently been introduced in rail passenger transportation markets worldwide. Although the technologies for such operations have levelled at speeds of around 300 km/h, the operating parameters to be adopted in each application will differ from country to country. The operating environment will be one of the crucial success factors for the implementation of HST operations in China. This paper compares three different management/ownership models which might be used in China. The paper analyzes the characteristics of each model and proposes an optimal plan of an operational system to develop HST operations in China by using a hierarchy goals achievement matrix approach.
