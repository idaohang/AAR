The paper discusses a research project on septic tank treatment performance and an evaluation of factors that influence performance. Outcomes derived lay the groundwork for improved regulatory strategies for on-site domestic sewage treatment in Queenslandâ€™s Logan City Council area. Key factors, which influence system performance, such as effluent quality, householder maintenance practices and site characteristics, were evaluated during the study. This research is expected to contribute to providing a rational basis for strengthening regulatory strategies governing on-site sewage treatment and furnish a specific focus for undertaking public information strategies relating to septic tank operation and maintenance.    Based on the outcomes of the study, a number of important conclusions were derived and recommendations made. The householder survey revealed that there is very limited appreciation of the need for regular maintenance of septic tanks. The testing of effluent from the distribution box showed that the performance of a large number of the septic tanks was unsatisfactory. Half of the septic tanks investigated were found to have excessive sludge build up leading to inadequate retention capacity and resulting in plug flow through the tank. The soil and landscape analysis undertaken of the sites indicate that most of the sites had characteristics which are not conducive for conventional subsurface effluent disposal.
