The use of coordinates as a description and their limitation is analysed given the recent advances and proliferation of GPS measurement technology in the surveying and mapping industry. While the use of coordinates is in essence a representation of the reality at a given point in time, it is shown that they can be used within a well-defined framework for summary purposes. The issues surrounding GPS calibration and traceability are explored as a means of demonstrating conformance to suitably recognised quantities of length and time.     A rural property boundary survey undertaken for subdivision purposes is investigated in some detail to provide comparative discussion on issues of changing methods and evolving technology approaches to a measurement challenge using GPS techniques.
