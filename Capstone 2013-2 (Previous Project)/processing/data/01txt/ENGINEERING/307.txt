This paper describes the findings of a state-of-the-art literature review on the energy consumption of land based freight transport modes and outlines the development of a model to compare corridor energy consumption of road and rail options. The key parameters influencing the energy estimation and comparison procedure are identified and a methodology to compare door to door freight movement is provided.
