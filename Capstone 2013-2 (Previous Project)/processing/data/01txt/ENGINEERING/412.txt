Gypsum plasterboard is a common lining material for steel wall frame systems used in combination with cold-formed steel studs (C or lipped C-sections).  However, the design of these wall frames does not utilise the full strengthening effects of plasterboard in carrying axial loads. Therefore an experimental study was conducted to investigate the local and overall buckling behaviour of the studs in these frames using a total of 40 full-scale wall frame tests and stub column tests. The tests included unlined, both sides lined and one-side lined wall frames and studs.  Test results were compared with predictions from the Australian standard AS 4600-1996 and the American specification AISI-1996. This paper presents the details of the experimental study, the results, and comparisons with design code predictions.
