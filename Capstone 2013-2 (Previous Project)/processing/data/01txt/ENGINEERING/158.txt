In this paper we investigate the statistical properties of the path power and Doppler frequency shift for the recently-proposed hyperbolic macrocell channel model. It is well-known that the Doppler spectrum is dependent on the probability density function of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the multipath components at the mobile station and the direction of motion of the mobile. We derive and simulate the joint probability density  functions (pdfs) of the power-DOA and the power-Doppler shift.
