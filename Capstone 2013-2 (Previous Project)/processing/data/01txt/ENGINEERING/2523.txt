This Working Paper reports on contract research commissioned by the Policy &amp; Planning Unit of the Traffic &amp; Transport Branch of the Brisbane City Council (BCC). Current BCC and Queensland Transport targets for the mode share of PT in Brisbane and the South East Queensland (SEQ) Region call for a substantial increase in PT usage in both absolute and relative terms. In order to assess the appropriateness of those targets, it is necessary to determine:    (a)	recent trends in Brisbane PT patronage levels;   (b)	the set of demographic, socio-economic and employment trends which directly or indirectly impact on PT markets;   (c)	the likely future trends in those factors; and  (d)	the network supply and technological changes which will impact on the performance of competing modes.    Decisions about the strategies and actions needed to bring about the desired PT mode share targets need to be informed by such an analysis. Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this Working Paper address the above issues in turn. Section 5 presents a discussion of the main implications of the findings for future PT demand in Brisbane. The strategies likely to be necessary to achieve the PT mode share targets set by the BCC for the next 10 years, are also discussed at this stage.
