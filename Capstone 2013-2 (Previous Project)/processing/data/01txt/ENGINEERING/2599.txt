The current world-wide trend towards increased axle loads and faster trains has resulted in increased damage to heavy haul routes.  A simple, accurate method is required for determining track modulus, to improve track design and prediction of degradation.  The paper describes the on-going development of a mechanistic model for track modulus.  It also describes a series of field tests, with the following outcomes: comparison of  several methods for determining track modulus based on track deflection under load; achieving a better understanding of track behaviour under load; and calibration of the mechanistic model against test results.
