Implant loosening and mechanical failure are two major concerns for trans-femoral amputees using osseointegrated fixation. Understanding the true load applied on osseointegrated fixation is one important step in solving the two problems. Conventionally, the load magnitude can be calculated based on the motion of the prosthesis and the ground reaction forces measured by a force plate using inverse dynamics. However, this approach allowed only one or two walking steps to be measured and errors are compounded when involving more than one joint. In this study, we directly measured load acting on the abutment of an osseointegrated prosthesis with a load transducer for twelve trans-femoral amputees. Three-dimensional force and moment patterns at the abutment along a gait cycle were displayed. Step-to-step variability of each subject in various kinetic and temporal parameters as well as subject-to-subject variability in temporal parameters were found low. High subject-to-subject variability in force and moment data was demonstrated.
