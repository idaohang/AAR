Some algorithms for estimating the instantaneous frequency of a constant-amplitude phase-modulated signal are reviewed and compared in terms of computational and statistical efficiency. Each of the algorithms is briefly described. The computational requirements for each algorithm are presented in tabular form, and the variance of each estimator (obtained through simulation) is plotted against theoretically derived lower variance bounds. An explanation is provided as to why each estimator performs as it does, and recommendations are given for the method which should be used for a given signal class
