Problem Based Learning (PBL) is a valid educational tool gaining rapid acceptance throughout the construction management education world.  PBL relies on a case study approach through which educators impart the necessary theory to the students.  The case study allows the students to easily comprehend the relevance and practical applications of the theory.  This paper is a case study of a PBL unit and examines a number of issues including the structure of the unit, assessment, level of teaching and student workloads.  More importantly however, this paper presents the views of the students and academic staff involved in the unit.  This examination will demonstrate that despite some considerable acceptance problems from the students and uncertainty amongst the academics involved, the unit was considered to be a success by the majority and provided a valuable contrast to the more traditional approaches to teaching construction management.
