In this paper, we present a study of the bit error rate (BER) performance of DS-CDMA system over a frequency selective multipath Rayleigh fading channel with perfect power  control. The standard Gaussian approximation (SGA) is used to evaluate the BER performance for the DS-CDMA. The performance of DS-CDMA over the frequency selective fading channel is examined with the varying numbers of multipath components, varying numbers of interfering cells, and various process gain. From the simulation results we have seen that the BER performance is affected by these parameters.
