In this paper we present a space-time geometricalbased channel model for a macrocell mobile environment. We consider reverse link with a uniform linear antenna array.  This model combines scalar stochastic fading model (for local scatterers) with the geometrical hyperbolic model (for dominant reflectors). We assume one resolvable path for each dominant reflector. The proposed model provides statistics of the direction of-  arrival (DOA), fading amplitude, time delay, and phase data for wireless communication channels. The model is also useful for designing a forward link beamformer.
