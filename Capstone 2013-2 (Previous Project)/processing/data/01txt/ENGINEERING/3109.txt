This research is aimed at developing a low-cost high-integrity airborne navigation system for General Aviation (GA) aircraft, utilising the Australian Ground Based Regional Augmentation System (GRAS) (See figure at right).  This will mean safer, more reliable, air navigation  using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and GRAS.    Specifically, the project goals are:     Development of new strategies to aid in the GPS integrity monitoring process by bridging outages in the GRAS VHF network, using low-cost MEMS technology inertial sensors, air data sensors and GPS Doppler velocity vector processing;   Implementation of a navigation sensor architecture onto a prototype system for field-testing;   Evaluation of integrity performance of the prototype system with flight tests through GRAS outage areas;
