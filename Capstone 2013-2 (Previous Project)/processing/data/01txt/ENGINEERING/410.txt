Past research into the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels has been based on polyurethane foams and thicker lower grade steels. The Australian sandwich panels use polystyrene foam and thinner and high strength steels, which are bonded together using separate adhesives. Therefore a research project on Australian sandwich panels was undertaken using experimental and finite element analyses. The experimental study on 50 foam-supported steel plate elements and associated finite element analyses produced a large database for sandwich panels subject to local buckling effects, but revealed the inadequacy of conventional effective width formulae for panels with slender plates. It confirmed that these design rules could not be extended to slender plates in their present form. In this research, experimental and numerical results were used to improve the design rules. This paper presents the details of experimental and finite element analyses, their results and the improved design rules.
