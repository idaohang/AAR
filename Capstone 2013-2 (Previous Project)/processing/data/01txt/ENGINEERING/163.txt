The European initiative for the provision of Radionavigation Satellite Services (RNSS) â€“ GALILEO - will comprise all segments for an independent and fully operational infrastructure under civil control. Some of the signal transmissions will share carrier frequencies and some of the available spectrum with the USGPS system. Signals on common centre frequencies have been designed for functional inter- operability, making GPS and GALILEO two systems of the next generation infrastructure for Global Navigation Satellite Services. The GALILEO system architecture comprises a space segment, the associated ground  segment for performance monitoring and satellite control and, last but not least, the User segment. This paper provides a general overview of the GALILEO architecture. The individual segments of the GALILEO architecture and their internal interaction are described. Finally, external interfaces to other systems for the provisioning of time as well as the boundaries of the GALILEO system are explained.
