As recent coalition operations have clearly demonstrated, TUAVs have become  an increasingly vital part of a force Commander's ISTAR strategy. While TUAVs can be  launched and recovered in relatively small cleared areas, there is still a need to assist in the rapid selection of suitable L&amp;R sites. This paper presents the results of a new automated approach to rapidly identify these suitable L&amp;R areas. This system is based on the availability of detailed topographic information, GIS data and advanced image processing tools. The results of the test case analysis around Dili, East Timor demonstrate the automated selction of a number of potential L&amp;R sites based on GIS data. Use of the methodology resulted in a reduction of the number of potential sites from approximately 14500 down to 36. Overall the test analysis clearly shows that the methodology is capable of automating and considerably simplifying the L&amp;R site selection process.
