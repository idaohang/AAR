We present a geometrical and time-variant wireless vector channel model with hyperbolically distributed scatterers for a macrocell mobile environment. This model is based on the assumption that the scatterers are arranged circularly around the mobile station, whereby the distance between the mobile and the local scatterers and the distance between the local scatterers and the dominant scatterers are distributed hyperbolically. The proposed model allows investigation of beamforming aspects as well as space-time processing techniques. Simulation results for this model are presented and compared with the exponential model results.
