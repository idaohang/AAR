The concept of rearranging property boundaries in rural areas has been addressed in principle in previous work (Hannigan and webb 1992). This study sets out to incorporate LIS Technology as a key communication element in explaining the need for, and potential solutions offered by a rearrangement of boundaries. A pilot study area was selected and over it a computer based land information system assembled. This LIS was then used in group and individual discussions with the landholders, local authority and other interested parties. This report details the opportunities and constraints identified in collecting the data into a LIS and makes recommendations for improving the process. Recommendations are made about the need for change in the farming operations in the study area aand the need for progress towards a long-term sustainable system. Finally, comments are made about the distribution of land, and the prospect for a re-arrangement some time in the future.
