The annual surveying field camp to Pittsworth /Linthorpe was again a successful event despite some extremes in the weather. The school of PLAS Computing laboratory, Photogrammetric laboratory and SPC laboratory will be closed from early December to the beginning of February to allow for the specialist surveying and mapping instrumentation to be moved to the other side of the campus into the New â€˜Dâ€™ buildings. Final Year Surveying and Mapping students and double-degree surveying/info technology students made professional presentations on their research project/topic in the Owen .J.Wordsworth rooms recently.
