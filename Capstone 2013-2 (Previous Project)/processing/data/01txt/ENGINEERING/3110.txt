Airservices Australia has recently proposed the use of a Ground-based Regional Augmentation System (GRAS) to improve the safety of using the NAVSTAR Global  Positioning System (GPS) in aviation. The GRAS Airborne Receiver Development project  (GARD) is being conducted by QUT in conjunction with Airservices Australia and GPSat  Systems. The aim of the project is to further enhance the safety and reliability of GPS and GRAS by incorporating smart sensor technology including advanced GPS signal processing and Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Sensor (MEMS) based inertial components.  GARDSim is a GPS and GRAS receiver simulation environment which has been developed for  algorithm development and analysis in the GARD project. GARDSim is capable of simulating  any flight path using a given aeroplane flight model, simulating various GPS, GRAS and inertial system measurements and performing high integrity navigation solutions for the flight. This paper discusses the architecture and capabilities of GARDSim. Simulation results will be presented to demonstrate the usefulness of GARDSim as a simulation environment for algorithm development and evaluation.
