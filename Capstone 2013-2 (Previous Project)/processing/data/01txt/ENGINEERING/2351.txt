Over the last decade, longer, heavier and more powerful multi-combination vehicles (MCVs) have been permitted to use certain road freight routes in Australia, including those with signalised intersections.  This paper documents field tests conducted to measure through passenger car equivalences (PCEs) of three MCVs used in Queensland in the simulated environment of a signalised intersection.  The results demonstrate that PCE increases with vehicle mass, implying that MCVs may have a potentially greater impact upon signalised intersection operation than would be determined when assuming a standard heavy vehicle PCE of 2 for the through movement.  There may be a need to distinguish between the combinations that comprise the heavy vehicle spectrum when assessing MCV routes on corridors with signalised intersections.    Results demonstrate that less intersection time would be used in carrying a given payload when using larger, more freight-efficient MCVs. However, other operational parameters must also be examined, including vehicle paths, sight lines, signal setting requirements, and pavement damage.  Further, perceptions of road users and affected communities must be addressed. Results also demonstrate that larger MCVs are more efficient in terms of overall intersection queue storage requirements in carrying a given freight task. Notwithstanding, queue storage requirements of individual MCVs must be addressed in isolation due to their length. The findings of this work will be informative to analysis of signalised intersection operation on designated MCV routes in Australia.
