This report forms part of research for the project, Evaluation of Freight Corridor Mode Performance.  The project hypothesis is that the transport planning and freight transport decision making processes could be better informed by developing a model that represents in detail the process of mode selection for corridor freight movements, using key performance indicators.  The overall project aim is to develop a computer based model and to include a freight corridor in Queensland as a case study.  This report covers two aspects of the Evaluation of Freight Corridor Mode Performance project:-  â€¢	Modal Performance; and  â€¢	Towards an Assessment Model.  Section 2, Modal Performance, provides a review of research undertaken for the quantifying of performance indicators.  The aim of the research is to locate sufficient data for use in comparing transport modes based on the determinants and performance indicators.  Section 3, Towards an Assessment Tool, describes the development of a spreadsheet that may be used for Freight Trip Comparison.  It describes the layout and use of the Evaluation Spreadsheet model developed.
