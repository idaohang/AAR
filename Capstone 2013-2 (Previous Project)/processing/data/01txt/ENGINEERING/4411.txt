There are a number of purposes to this paper.  Primarily I want to describe the learning that has taken place during my coaching time working with seated throwers.  Secondly I want to share useful and practical information of the coaching process with current and future coaches.  I particularly want to highlight the technical improvements in the throwing pattern and describe how this was achieved by making changes in technique, strength and conditioning, and frame design.
