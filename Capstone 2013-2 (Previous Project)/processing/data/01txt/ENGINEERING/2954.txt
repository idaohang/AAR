Monolimb refers to a trans-tibial prosthesis having the socket and the shank molded into one piece of thermoplastics. It has a characteristic that the shank could deflect during walking stimulating motions at ankle joints. Positive feedbacks were gained including improved gait efficiency and comfort from patients using prostheses with deformable shanks. Comfort and gait could be further improved by properly raising the shank flexibility. However, structural integrity should be remained which resists buckling of the prosthesis. Till now there is no guideline for the shank design of monolimb.    Currently, the structural test specifications of lower limb prostheses are specified in ISO10328. To optimize the design of the shank, monolimbs with different shank designs have to be subjected to tests according to the ISO standards. Performing such test experimentally is expensive and time demanding. Two approaches help ease the problem.  A statistical approach developed by Taguchi using orthogonal arrays allows the design of an experiment involved a few well chosen tests but contains all main factor effects. Finite element (FE) analysis allows parametric analyses to be done efficiently.    In this work, FE analysis and Taguchi method were used to predict possible failure under structural test and identify which parameter is most sensitive to the overall performance. This promotes further optimization of the shank design of monolimbs.
