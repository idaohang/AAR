A novel method is proposed to extract dynamic tone features using 2D  oriented filters. As 2D oriented filters are capable of capturing pitch  orientations, they can make full use of the information from neighbouring  frames to extract dynamic tone features without knowing pitch or  using pitch tracking algorithms. Experimental results show that the  proposed method can produce dynamic tone features of good quality.
