A conceptual study was undertaken to comprehensively investigate the dynamic characteristics of slender suspension footbridges with shallow cable profiles under human-induced dynamic loads. This paper concerns their vibration under eccentrically distributed walking dynamic loads. A suspension footbridge model with reverse profiled cables in vertical and horizontal planes is proposed for this study, and three types of bridge models are considered in the numerical analysis to study the effects of cable configuration and reverse profiled cables. It is found that these slender footbridge structures exhibit coupled vibration modes such as coupled lateral-torsional or coupled torsional-lateral modes in addition to vertical ones. Research results show that large amplitude lateral vibration is mainly caused by the resonant vibration in coupled modes. When the first coupled lateral-torsional mode is excited, the large amplitude lateral vibration is induced by the lateral dynamic force; while when the first coupled torsional-lateral mode is excited, the excessive lateral vibration is mainly caused by the vertical dynamic force and enhanced by the lateral dynamic force. It is also found that when vertical vibration mode is excited, the dynamic effect of eccentric dynamic vertical force has only slight effect on lateral vibration. The research finding will be helpful to understand the dynamic behaviour of slender suspension footbridges with coupled vibration modes under human-induced dynamic loads.
