This edition features some material of interest derived from the wealth of acquired knowledge contained in The Queensland Surveyor newsletters; The Bulletin; Queensland Surveyors Bulletin; The Queensland Surveyor; and the current name of The Queensland Surveyor Journal. Bob Skitch has done a marvellous job of researching the history aspects for the changing fame and fortunes of the Qld Institution of Surveyors publication since it was first incorporated in 1900. As Bob mentions, the name itself of the bulletin/ newsletter/ journal has completed a full circle. The front cover image of this last Queensland Surveyor journal reflects the sampling of the cover designs, shapes and forms held in the institution archives.
