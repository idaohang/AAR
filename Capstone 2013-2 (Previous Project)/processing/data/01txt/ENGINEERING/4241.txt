This paper presents a study on mitigating the seismic response of shear wall structures by using  dampers strategically located within them. The stiffness of the cut out section of the shear wall  is replaced by the stiffness and damping of the device. Friction, Viscoelastic and Hybrid  dampers in different configurations and at different locations are used to evaluate the peak  deflections and accelerations, under several earthquake records. Results from this conceptual  study have demonstrated the feasibility of using these dampers to mitigate the adverse seismic  effects of these structures, even under resonant conditions.
