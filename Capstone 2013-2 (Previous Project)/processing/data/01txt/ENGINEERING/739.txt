Measuring the parameters of the pupil in the human eye has become increasingly important in customised refractive surgery and other eye care applications. High-speed and high resolution CMOS cameras can be used to study the dynamics of eyelids and their interaction with the pupil at different illumination levels. We consider the problem of measuring the pupil size from a high-speed video. In particular, we develop a novel algorithm for setting intra-lid sectors for the detection and estimation of the pupil and iris outlines from a sequence of digital images. An application of the proposed methodology to the estimation of the pupil parameters during an eye blink is given.
