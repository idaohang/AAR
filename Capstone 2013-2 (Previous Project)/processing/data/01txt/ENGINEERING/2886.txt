Kelvin Grove Urban Village (KGUV) is a $400 million joint initiative of the Queensland Government and the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), delivered in association with the private sector.  It is located on 16 ha of land at the former Gona Army Barracks site, next to QUT-Kelvin Grove, and within 2 km of the Brisbane CBD.  The development will incorporate around 800 residential units, QUT faculty buildings, shops, restaurants and cafes, all connected by parks and paths intended to promote walking and cycling.  One of the strategic goals of the KGUV Master Plan is to &quot;ensure that people using the urban village can be less car dependant than the general Brisbane population&quot;.  This reduction in car dependency requires not only the creation of active transport links within the urban village, but also the existence or creation of such links to the wider city.  A project was conducted between June and October 2005, to:  â€¢	Study and qualify regional accessibility to and from KGUV by active transport modes (walking, cycling, and public transport); and   â€¢	Identify proposals that will likely improve the regional transport systemâ€™s capability to provide for effective accessibility to KGUV by active transport.  A GIS was the primary tool used for the analyses carried out in this study, and allowed the mapping of pedestrian, cycle, bus, train and ferry infrastructure, and the subsequent identification of where improvements may be made to the network.  The GIS-based transport analysis software TLOS was used for the first time in Brisbane to integrate both temporal and spatial features of bus and train services into a single analysis.  This paper discusses the use of GIS in transport planning, and the TLOS software in particular, as well as some of the project findings.
