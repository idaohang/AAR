Demands of freight and passenger traffic are often considered to be in competition, particularly on designated urban freight routes that  use major arterial signalised traffic corridors. A microsimulation model of an urban traffic corridor in Brisbane was developed in order for corridor performance to be evaluated for alternative priority treatments. The model was calibrated with GPS travel time and trajectory data for a range of vehicle classes typical of those found on Australian urban freight routes. Intersection status  was recorded simultaneously by the STREAMS traffic management  system,  enabling  the  progression  of  different  vehicle  classes  to  be  validated  under existing signal timing plans.   The model can be applied to the optimisation of corridor signal timings. Unlike other models, it was possible to define vehicle-specific performance measures, such as delay, number of stops, and a combination of these. The model can be used to find the best combination of signal timings to favour the progression of particular vehicle classes, such as large freight vehicles. The effects on other vehicle classes can be noted; finding that, although being suboptimal for other classes, it may be possible to achieve some overall gains in traffic efficiency.
