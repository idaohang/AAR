In Australia, railway track maintenance costs comprise between 25-35 percent of total freight train operating costs.  Track maintenance planning models have been shown to reduce maintenance costs by 5 to 10 percent though improved planning.  This paper describes a model which has been developed to deal with the track maintenance planning function at the medium to long-term levels.  This model simulates the impacts of degrading railway track conditions and related maintenance work, in contrast to tradition models that mainly use expert systems.   The model simulates the degrading track condition using an existing track degradation model.  Track condition data from that model is used to determine if safety related speed restrictions are needed and what immediate maintenance work may be required for safe train operations.  The model outputs the net present value of the benefits of undertaking a given maintenance strategy, when compared with a base-case scenario.  The model approach has advantages over current models in investigating what if scenarios.  The track engineer can assess the possible benefits in reduced operating costs from upgrading track infrastructure or from the use of improved maintenance equipment.  After describing the model inputs and the assumptions used, the paper deals with the simulation of track maintenance and of train operating costs over time.  The results of applying the model to a test track section using a number of different maintenance strategies are also given.
