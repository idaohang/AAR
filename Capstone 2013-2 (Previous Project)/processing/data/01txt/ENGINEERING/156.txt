Space-time geometrical channel models proved to be of significance in wireless communications as they provide spatial information (i.e. DOA, TOA) by which the performance of wireless communication systems and space-time systems (i.e., smart  antennas, beamformers) can be analyzed. This paper presents a comparative study of space-time geometrical channel models. Based on the methods through which the models incorporate  Doppler fading, we divide these models into two categories: models with oscillated scattering objects and models with unoscillated scattering objects. The main characteristics of each category have been studied using the existing models.
