The implementation of optimum farming practices is seriously impeded by inappropriate relationship of property boundaries to the landform. This project investigates the problems brought about by the conflict of farm boundaries with the natural landform. This project examines the many issues and impacts relating to a proposal of rearrangeing cadastral boundaries in a trial area in the Linthorpe Creek Catchement near Pittsworth, Darling Downs, Queensland, Australia.
