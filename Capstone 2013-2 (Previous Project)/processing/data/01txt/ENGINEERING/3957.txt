Welcome to the first edition of The Queensland Surveyor for the year 2002.  With the tremendous changes and activities occurring at many levels in 2001, we hope that year 2002 will be bigger and better than the year before and that the surveying practitioner can rise to the challenge of the goals that they set themselves.
