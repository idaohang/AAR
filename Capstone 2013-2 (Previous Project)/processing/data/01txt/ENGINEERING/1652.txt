The parametric study explores the potential for reducing cooling and heating loads through changes in construction types for dwellings in Brisbane. Based on a previous study completed at QUT, a plan type and building materials is used as the base case of the computer runs. Various combinations of roof, floor, and wall construction form the control variables. Comparative results exhibit even the simplest changes can help providing an increase in thermal comfort of the occupants and cause a decrease in the dependence on mechanical heating and cooling systems. The study also includes a comparative economic analysis. This approach can provide an increase in occupant satisfaction and result in considerable savings in domestic energy consumption.
