Recently we have proposed a new structure for efficient single-bit filtering. The system consists of a ternary finite impulse response filter and a remodulating low-pass infinite  impulse response filter. Embedded within the remodulating filter is a sigma-delta modulator. In this work we examine several interpolation methods for generating the ternary taps, along with their effect on the system frequency response.
