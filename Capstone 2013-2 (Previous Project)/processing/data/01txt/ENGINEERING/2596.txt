Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are an important  diagnostic resource in determining the presence or absence  of clinical seizures in neonates. These nonstationary  signals require some form of nonstationary analysis to  detect seizures in the EEG data. A time-frequency (TF)  matched lter has been previously proposed to detect seizures  in both adult and newborn EEG. A method which constructs  a reference or template set from a feature of EEG  seizures, rather than the whole EEG seizure, displayed the  most promising results. However this method suffered from  an inability to adequately represent patient variability in the  template set while simultaneously maintaining a low false  detection rate. A new method of the TF matched lter is  proposed that halves the template set required by approximating  the templates with a more general ambiguity domain  function representation. This proposed method is also less  sensitive to false detections when a larger reference set is  used, as evidenced by the ndings on both simulated and  real neonatal EEG.
