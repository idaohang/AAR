Intermodal terminals are critical elements in the total freight transportation chain. They provide the interface not only between modes, but also between shippers and carriers. Therefore, the performance of those terminals needs to be closely monitored and their operations optimised with respect to the two key performance areas, namely: customer service and operational efficiency. This paper deals with the development and use of computer simulation  models to be used in two types of terminal: conventional road/rail container transfer facility; and RoadRailer terminal facility.    The major factors influencing terminal performance are briefly dealt with, together with some of the measures which can be used to monitor the level of performance in a given terminal. The paper provides a detailed description of the simulation models developed for the two terminal types, together with the results obtained when the models were used to predict operating performance under different resource scenarios. Three RoadRailer terminal options were simulated ranging from low to high levels of resources. The final decision regarding the most appropriate level of resources rests on a compromise between performance targets, trailer breakdown expectation and overall operating cost.    It was found that containers are handled faster than RoadRailer trailers for train loading purposes. However, such comparisons do not take into account the full set of costs which are incurred when operating both types of terminals. The initial capital costs, in terms of track and mobile equipment, are significantly higher in the case of conventional container terminals.
