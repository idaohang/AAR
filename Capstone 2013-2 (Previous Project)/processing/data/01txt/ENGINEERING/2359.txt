Researchers at Queensland University of Technology have recently commenced a study into the impacts of large freight vehicles on urban traffic networks. This paper presents preliminary findings of the PhD project investigating those impacts. Multi-combination vehicles (MCVs), comprising road freight vehicles consisting of a prime mover towing two or more trailers, are becoming more prevalent on Australiaâ€™s road networks in both rural and urban areas. Although requiring fewer vehicles to perform the same freight task compared to smaller vehicles, the greater delay caused by these vehicles at urban intersections needs to be considered. This delay is attributed to the poorer acceleration capability and greater length of MCVs. A model has been developed to predict the acceleration capability of MCVs and was validated against a range of full-scale tests conducted elsewhere. The resultant effect on delay and capacity at signalised intersections is also studied.
