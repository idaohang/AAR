It is recommended that timber bridges are inspected at a minimum of two year intervals to determine and rate the condition of the structure to enable the scheduling of maintenance and determine the effectiveness of past maintenance treatments.  During these inspections it is necessary that a visual inspection be undertaken in conjunction with a drilling survey of all major structural elements.     Unfortunately current methods of drilling can promote the deterioration of these structural elements and the reserves of timber that are suitable for bridge construction and maintenance are scarce.  It is therefore imperative that asset managers consider using alternative methods such as Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) during routine inspections.    The Resistograph is a quasi non-destructive evaluation tool that was developed for testing the soundness of European softwoods that is now available in Australia.  This paper will present the results of testing the resistograph on timber hardwood bridge.
