The Australian Federation Satellite, FedSat, was successfully launched into a 780-km low-earth orbit on 14 December 2002. Since then, the onboard Blackjack GPS receiver has operated on a duty cycle basis, providing effective data sets at an average of 10 to 15 minutes per orbit with its only aft-looking antenna, which views a field of two-third of the hemisphere. This paper presents the technical description of the FedSat Orbit Determination and Tracking (FODT) software, which is used to perform FedSat orbit  filtering and prediction on daily basis. We present results from GPS flight data sets of two periods: the very first 24 hour data collected on Day 364/02 and the very first data sets of 5 consecutive days in March 2003. The analysis is focused on the evaluation of the FedSat flight GPS data quality and the accuracy of orbit propagation solutions currently achievable with the FODT software. The results from the two data periods have shown that the FODT derived FedSat orbits from code measurements can be propagated forward 72 and 96 hours with the maximal orbit errors of 120m and 240m respectively, which will satisfy the precise pointing requirement for Ka-Band tracking. In general, these preliminary FedSat orbit determination results are considered encouraging and promising, given consideration of rather harsh FedSat observational environment.
