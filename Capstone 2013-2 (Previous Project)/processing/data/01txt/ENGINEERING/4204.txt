Onsite wastewater treatment systems are becoming more widely accepted as long term wastewater treatment systems in areas not serviced by centralised sewerage systems. However, the current means of assessing site and soil conditions to provide adequate treatment and dispersal of domestic wastewater has been a major drawback in achieving specific performance outcomes. In Australia, it is the responsibility of local governments to assess and approve the use of onsite systems, and appreciable variations in standards and codes exist between different jurisdictions. The main aim of this research was to develop a scientific framework for assessing onsite systems, based on risk assessment and management principles thereby allowing more appropriate integration across local government boundaries. A case study illustrating the implementation of the risk framework is also presented.
