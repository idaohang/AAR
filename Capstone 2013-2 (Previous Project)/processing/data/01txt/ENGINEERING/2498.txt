This report has summarised the work undertaken at QUT as part of a research project sponsored by the Federal Transit Administration in the US. The project was administered by the US Transportation Research Board of the National Research Council, under TCRP Project G-6: 'A Guidebook for Developing a Transit Performance-Measurement System'. Kittelson and Associates Inc. acted as the principal investigators and other participants included Urbitran Inc., LKC Consulting Services, MORPACE International, Inc. and Yuko Nakanishi.     The stated objective of this research is:    'to produce a practical, user-friendly guidebook that will assist transit system managers in developing a performance-measurement system that uses traditional and nontraditional performance indicators and measures to address customer-oriented and community issues.'  As well as an extensive literature review, a total of 19 transit planning agencies and operators were interviewed for the overall project, regarding the performance measures currently in use. The results are available in the form of several project reports, which are currently in draft form, including:    â€¢	TCRP G-6: A guidebook for developing a transit performance measurement system: Literature Review, September 2001;   â€¢	TCRP G-6: A guidebook for developing a transit performance measurement system: Interim Report, December 2001; and  â€¢	TCRP G-6: A guidebook for developing a transit performance measurement system: Performance measure summary, December 2001.    As part of the team working on the project QUT reviewed a number of existing transit performance based contracts in several countries. This report deals with the review of evidence from agencies and operators.  The summary provided here is based on documents obtained from agencies and operators, as well as on personal communication with a number of individuals in 12 organisations in Australia, US, UK, Norway and South Africa.
