E-1(PCM -30) Stream is a European Telecommunication standard for communication of data/voice channels in a digital network. This paper will deal with the design and implementation of a transparent stream analyzer, capable of handling (up to 2 Mbps) E-1  stream and analyzing 30 voice /data channels using an out-of-band Common Channel Signaling System number 7(CCSS7) [1] protocol .The analyzer is capable of generating an E-1 stream and thus can be used for generation, monitoring and blocking of channels. The  analyzer can be used to test any E-1 link. As our analyzer performs the analysis functions in the software it is very flexible and can perform many additional features such as algorithms and protocols testing and analysis.
