Vibration is a serviceability limit state for the design of suspended floor systems in buildings  that is not well understood by many structural engineers. Dynamic behaviour is an important  design consideration for slender, two-way floors, particularly for those of post-tensioned  concrete construction. At present, there are no reliable design guidelines that deal with this  problem. This paper describes a research program on the dynamic behaviour of posttensioned  concrete floors that is presently underway at Queensland University of Technology  in Brisbane, Australia. Results from this research will enable the development of much  needed design guidance on the dynamic behaviour post-tensioned concrete floors in  buildings.  A full-scale, post-tensioned slab specimen has been constructed in the universityâ€™s structural  laboratory. Purpose-designed support brackets have been fabricated which have enabled an  investigation on the effects of various support conditions at the corners of the specimen. A  series of static and dynamic tests are being performed in the laboratory to obtain basic  material properties and behavior of the specimen. Data collected from these experiments will  be used to tune finite element models for computational, parametric studies. Preliminary  finite element analyses of both composite and homogeneous material cross-sections have  been calibrated against results from initial laboratory experiments. Further field  instrumentation and testing of floors in existing buildings will be conducted to validate  computational studies. These computational studies will be expanded to generate predictive  guidelines for the free vibration and response of two-way, post-tensioned concrete floors.
