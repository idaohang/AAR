On 14th December 2002, the Australian small satellite FedSat was launched with a Japanese HII-A rocket into an 800 km sun-synchronous orbit with an inclination of 98.6 degrees. One of the payloads is a dual frequency GPS BlackJack receiver from NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). This receiver provides a Position, Velocity and Time (PVT) solution and also raw measurements (code and carrier), which will be used in different ways for  Precise Orbit Determination (POD), Orbit Determination (OD) based on GPS position solutions, 2-axis Attitude Determination (AD) and atmospheric experiments.
