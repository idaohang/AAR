E-business (B2B and B2C) is expected to dramatically change the way business is conducted. Assessment of the likely impact of e-business on the transport system, and hence on the natural and built environment, is thus needed. This paper reports some early findings from a study to consider e-business trends and design a procedure for rating and ranking transport impacts of e-business for Australian conditions. The study is based on interviews with experts and the results of a review of current evidence. There is an emphasis on assessing likely environmental implications such as changes in levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
