A suspension footbridge model with reverse profiled cables is proposed to investigate the vibration characteristics of shallow suspension pedestrian bridge structures in this paper. Two types of cable configurations are considered for the proposed suspension footbridge model. It is found that suspension footbridges with shallow cable profiles often have coupled vibration modes and the influence of coupling can be described by a &quot;coupling coefficient&quot; defined as the ratio of vertical component to the lateral one. Research shows that the cable section, cable sag and span length have significant effects on the coupled vibration modes, and the coupling coefficient has great effect on the lateral dynamic amplification factor (DAF). Under crowd walking dynamic loads, larger DAF of lateral vibration is expected for the vibration mode with smaller coupling coefficient. The information generated in this conceptual study is useful in understanding the complex behaviour of this type of slender footbridges and helpful in developing design guidance for safe and efficient performance.
