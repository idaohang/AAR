The &quot;Polynomial Phase transform (PPT)&quot;, was presented in [l] as a tool for the estimation of the parameters of constant amplitude polynomial phase signals. Extensions of the algorithm have also been proposed in [2] to be able to deal with parameter estimation for multiple components and for time-varying amplitude. While the PPT is computationally efficient and almost statistically efficient at high signal to noise ratio (SNR), it fails catastrophically at low SNR. This paper presents an extension so that the PPT can operate at lower SNRs. The proposed algorithm is iterative: and uses a similar approach to that used for parameter estimation of quadratic phase signals in [3], [4] and [5].
