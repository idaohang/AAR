Transtibial amputees usually demonstrate some gait abnormalities which are due to the loss of active motions of the ankle joint.  Prostheses have been designed to compensate for the loss of motions by incorporating flexible keels or shanks. Extensive research has been carried out to look into the  benefits given by those components. However, the effect of the introduction of those flexible components on stresses at residual limb-prosthetic socket interface did not receive much attention.    The understanding of the stresses at limb-socket interface is fundamental to achieve a successful prosthesis fit. Theoretical analyses using finite element (FE) analysis has been widely used to study the interface stress. It offers advantages that stress, strain and motion in any parts of the model can be predicted and parametric analyses can be performed easily. In most previous FE models, only socket and the limb were involved and no attempt has been made to study the effect changes of distal components of the prostheses on interface stress.    In this study, a FE model with the limb and the whole prosthesis was created and the effect of the shank flexibility on limb-socket interface stresses were studied. The prosthesis studied here is a total thermoplastic prosthesis with the shank and socket molded into one piece of polypropylene material.
