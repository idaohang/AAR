CPNs has been a useful tool not only to approximate a discrete system but also to model a continuous process. In this paper, CPNs are augmented with maximal and minimal firing speeds, and Interval speed CPNs (ICPNs) is defined. The enabling and firing of transitions of ICPNs are discussed, and the enabling of continuous transitions is classified into three levels: 0-level, 1-level and 2-level. Some rules to calculate the instantaneous firing speeds are also developed. In addition, illustrative examples are presented.
