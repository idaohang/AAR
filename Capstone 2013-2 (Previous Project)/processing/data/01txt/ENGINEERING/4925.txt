Redland Shire Council (RSC) has recently completed the preparation of Integrated Local Transport Plan (ILTP) and started its implementation and monitoring program. One of the major thrusts of the ILTP is to reduce the car dependency in the Shire and increase the shares of other modes of transport, such as walking, cycling and public transport.     To achieve these objectives, a mathematical model is needed that is capable of modelling and forecasting the travelling mode choice behaviour in the multi modal environment of Redland Shire. Further, the model can be used in order to test public transport alternatives along with estimating the demand for the new public transport options.    This research attempts to calibrate a nested logit model using the data from the computer aided stated preference (SP) surveys being conducted in the Shire. The specification for the model is based on all the vital attributes of the travelling modes commonly used in the study area including various public transit access modes. It is expected that the outcomes of the research will assist policy makers in solving the strategic issues of transit planning and the future development of the network for transit access modes including walkways and cycleways.
