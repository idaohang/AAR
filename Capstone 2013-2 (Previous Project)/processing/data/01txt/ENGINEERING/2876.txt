During research underway at the Queensland University of Technology in the area of satellite technologies, the need for a fast, accurate and reliable star identification method presented itself. This paper presents one approach to solving this problem in a nonconventional manner. A Counter Propagation Neural Network has been implemented and tested producing favourable results. Presented in this paper is the incorporation of the Counter Propagation Neural Network into the star sensor, the network structure, simulations of implementations and results.
