This paper describes the development of a GPS transmission model for improving the attitude accuracy by modelling the GPS transmission path. Various factors are considered, such as receiving antenna gain, distance dependent path loss, effects of the ionosphere, GPS satellite transmitting antenna gain and varying GPS satellite transmission power.     The subsequent sections present a new single antenna attitude system based on signal strength. By incorporating a precisely measured spherical antenna gain pattern and a GPS transmission model, attitude can be estimated using a least square search. Finally, the improved attitude system is analysed by comparing to previous results. This paper concludes that further analysis is required for modelling the transmission path, particularly for the ionosphere and the GPS transmitting antenna gain.
