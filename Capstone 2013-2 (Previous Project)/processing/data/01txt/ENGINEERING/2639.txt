A theoretical study of steady transonic flows about axisymmetric and 3-D elongate bodies has been carried out within the framework of non-linear small disturbance theory using the transonic equivalence rule. A numerical method for calculating transonic flow about bodies of revolution was used by formulating the Alterating Direction Method together with monotone Engquist-Osherâ€™s algorithm for the axisymmetric case. This approach has a good reputation in solving similar two-dimensional problems.   A new effective algorithm to determine wave drag of bodies of revolution in inviscid transonic flow has been developed. As a result, the wave drag value is obtained by velocity jump integration along shocks closing local supersonic regions. This method is more exact then the ordinary method of integration of pressure along the body surface.    The efficiency of a numerical algorithm is demonstrated by calculating transonic flow over thin bodies of revolution. The results concerning calculations of the wave drag of elongate 3-D configurations of hypersonic aircraft in the framework of transonic equivalence rule are also given; these results were derived earlier by A.S. Fonarev and M.A. Naida, whilst working at the Central Aero-hydrodynamic Institute  (TsAGI), Moscow, Russia.
