This paper describes the evolutionary processes employed to profile the development of student capabilities as they are progressively developed within the Bachelors of Engineering (Civil, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical) courses at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The outcomes of these processes informed the formulation of new course objectives, formerly a set of value-centred principles, to ones of a student centred framework.  The frameworkâ€™s graduate capability statements were developed in a manner encompassing Engineers Australiaâ€™s requirements, and QUT and Faculty teaching and learning objectives, in consultation with academic staff from within and beyond the disciplines.  They relate discipline specific knowledge and skills, critical, creative and analytical thinking abilities, abilities to communicate, life long learning capacity, independent and collaborative working abilities, responsible professional practice, and self-reliance and leadership capabilities. The three engineering degree courses were examined on a unit-by-unit basis in terms of developing studentsâ€™ graduate capabilities, both discipline specific and generic, and linking these against the frameworkâ€™s objectives. This structure allows units to be refined and better integrated to improve the courseâ€™s development of student graduate capabilities, and facilitates an investigation into elements of the course that could be enhanced, or better achieved, through an enhanced work integrated learning program.
