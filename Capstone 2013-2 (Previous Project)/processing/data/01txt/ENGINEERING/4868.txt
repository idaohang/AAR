This paper describes recent advances in process design, made through the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling in the sugar industry and proposes that similar advances are possible in pulp and paper.  CFD models have proven to be very useful when used as an engineering design tool and as a research and development tool.  A significant advantage of computer-based simulation over pilot testing is the reduction in the time and capital cost required to investigate design changes.  However, the biggest advantage of computer simulations is that they allow the user to visualise the process in ways not otherwise possible, and do this without the high cost and risk to product quality or safety that exists with conventional experimental methods. This allows the traditional processes of technology development, through pilot plant testing and incremental changes at full scale, to be short cut or even bypassed completely. Real world applications of CFD modelling in the sugar industry are described in this paper. These include the reduction of CO, NOx, SOx and particle emissions from furnaces and optimising the design of several process plant items to maximise throughput and performance.  CFD is now routinely used by the Sugar Research Institute to examine, improve and refine process equipment in sugar factories.  All of these applications have very similar parallel applications within the pulp and paper industry.
