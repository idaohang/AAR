QUT final-year surveying and mapping science students have gained some valuable knowledge and experiences after a 16-day voyage from Cairns to Princess Charlotte Bay in Far North Queensland. The group made the expedition aboard the traditional sailing schooner; the 76-foot long &quot;SV Alexander Stewart&quot;. It was not only the lure of the sea, blue skies and warmer weather, but a chance to give 10 surveying and mapping students some practical skills in their chosen field of study.
