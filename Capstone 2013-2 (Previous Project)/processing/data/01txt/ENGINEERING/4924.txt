Redland Shire Council (RSC) has recently completed the preparation of Integrated Local Transport Plan (ILTP) and started its implementation and monitoring program. One of the major thrusts of the ILTP is to reduce the car dependency in the shire and increase the shares of other modes of transport, such as walking, cycling and public transport.     To achieve these objectives, a mathematical model is required that is capable of modelling and forecasting the travelling mode choice behaviour in the multi modal environment of Redland Shire. This model should be capable of modelling all types of travelling modes used in the shire with the use of various travelling alternatives as access modes. Further, this model can be used in order to test public transport alternatives along with estimating the demand for the new public transport options.     The present study attempts to develop a nested logit model and calibrate it using data obtained from a stated preference (SP) survey to be conducted in the shire. The model development will consider all the vital attributes of the travelling modes used in the study area including various public transit access modes. This report presents a state-of-the-art literature review done on travel mode choice modelling and SP survey instrument designing. Various travel demand models are presented and their features and calibration techniques discussed. Further, emphasis is made on the use of SP surveys and several aspects of survey instrument designing are described in detail.
