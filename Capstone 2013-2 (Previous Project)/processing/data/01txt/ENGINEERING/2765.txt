This paper presents a system overview of the UAV forced  landing site selection system and the results to date. The  forced landing problem is a new field of research for UAVs  and this paper will show the machine vision approach taken  to address this problem. The results are based on aerial  imagery collected from a series of flight trials in a Cessna  172.  The aim of this research is to locate candidate landing sites  for UAV forced landings, from aerial imagery. Output image  frames highlight the algorithmâ€™s selected safe landing  locations. The algorithms for the problem use image  processing techniques and neural networks for the  classification problem.  The system is capable of locating areas that are large enough  to land in and that are free of obstacles 92.3% Â± 2% (95%  confidence) of the time. These areas identified are then  further classified as to their surface type to a classification  accuracy of 90% Â± 3% (98% confidence).  It should be noted that although the system is being designed  primarily for the forced landing problem for UAVs, the  research can also be applied to forced landings or glider  applications for piloted aircraft.
