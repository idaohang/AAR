ABSTRACT: Timber was the material of choice for a large number of Australian infrastructure projects during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of these timber structures have lasted well and remain in use today. However, some important timber structures, particularly timber road and rail bridges, are reaching a critical point in their life as codes call on them to carry loads above their capacity or their condition has deteriorated to a point where they are no longer considered safe, or a combination of both. It is often not financially viable or convenient in the short term to replace these bridges. It is proposed it may be possible for managers of civil infrastructure to be able to quickly, inexpensively and significantly improve the structural behaviour of timber bridges and extend their service life until they are able to be taken out of service and replaced. This paper in-vestigates the use of fibre composite materials to rehabilitate timber structures such as these. In this prelimi-nary study unserviceable timber railway sleepers are externally reinforced with carbon fibre / epoxy laminates and tested to destruction. Conclusions on the effect of the externally bonded carbon fibre laminates are drawn.
