With increasing emphasis being placed on optimising the operation of the existing road network and additional pressure on funding, transport agencies are moving towards system engineering and asset management techniques to make more informed and uniform decisions across their networks. Infrastructure capital and maintenance systems are relatively mature, but for new technology such as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and traffic operation services, information and procedures to make decisions are not as advanced. ITS and traffic operation services are deployed to enhance the operations of the road network and can include devices, communications, software, policies, guidelines and processes. In some instances ITS and traffic operation services can offer more costeffective solutions to transport and traffic problems than traditional infrastructure solutions, and therefore must be considered in into strategic decision- aking. To ensure funding is directed to maximise community and agency objectives, a strategic, quantitative evaluation framework to prioritise traffic operation and ITS investment according to need and performance is necessary. The analytical framework must take into account traffic performance and customer and agency needs to inform realistic and affordable traffic operations and incident management intervention decisions. This research is aimed at reviewing existing systems, and developing and testing the essence of such a framework to suit a case study system. The literature review and a draft multi criteria analysis framework will be presented at the conference.
