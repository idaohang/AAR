The third year Land Surveying class was recently involved in the calibration process of a variety of the schoolsâ€™ total station (EDM) instrumentation at the Caboolture test range. Although the event started out rather slow and was a little muddy at times, calibration data was collected for six total stations in around seven hours.  We would like to extend our thanks to the Survey division at Caboolture shire for their assistance.
