This paper reports findings of experiments aiming to 1) compare the load tolerant ability over different regions of the residual limbs, 2) study the effect of walking on the load tolerant ability, and 3) examine the distal end weight-bearing ability supported by different interface materials.  The method was to apply increasing load to the residual limb until the pain level through a force transducer or a digital scale, considering the effect of regional difference, walking and interface materials.   Results show that the patellar tendon and the distal end of the fibula were the best and worst load tolerant region respectively.  Walking with prostheses tended to increase the load tolerant ability, believed due to the massage-like effect of the socket.   Different interface materials did not significantly alter the distal end weight-bearing ability.  However, there was a great difference in the distal end weight-bearing ability among different subjects.
