This paper presents a methodology for development of patient-specific finite element methods to predict the biomechanical outcomes of scoliosis surgery pre-operatively, with the aim of optimising the performance of instrumentation constructs for anterior single rod AIS surgery. The patient-specific finite element approach is an emerging technology still under development, but has potential to predict surgical correction, compliance of the surgically altered spine, and internal stress/strain in both the osseoligamentous spine and the rod/screw instrumentation system.
