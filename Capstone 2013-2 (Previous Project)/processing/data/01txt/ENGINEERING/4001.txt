Welcome to the August edition of The Queensland Surveyor for 2000. This edition contains a variety of topical issues, with an interesting comment of the future short-term applications of using Global Positioning Systems in a non-selective availability environment. For Surveyors, there is an increasing scope and potential markets to provide foundation spatially related information using a diversity of data-collection, analysis and presentation technologies.
