QUT students are now being trained in the latest technology following the acquisition of Geodetic surveying and mapping GPS hardware and software worth $125,000.  After twelve months of negotiation between QUT surveying staff and US Satellite Navigation firm Trimble Navigation and their Brisbane agents, Herga Ultimate Positioning, the Global Positioning System equipment has been installed.  Associate lecturer in the School of Planning, Landscape Architecture and Surveying Robert Webb said the leading edge GPS equipment could be worn like a back-pack and used in all weather conditions.
