We present a geometric multipath propagation model for a microcell mobile environment. The model provides the statistics for the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of multipath components; also it provides the multipath power delay profiles (PDP), which are used to evaluate the bit error rate (BER) and the signal to interference ratio (SIR) for the direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA). The probability density function (pdf) for the DOA under the proposed model is compared with experimental results for indoor multipath channel. The experimental results agreed with the proposed modelâ€™s simulation results.
