This research is being undertaken with the aim of developing a comprehensive understanding of the current travel behaviour of the residents of Redland Shire, South East Queensland. A unique computer based stated preference (SP) travel survey is being conducted in the study area to determine the current modal split and to calibrate a nested logit model to forecast the future travel behaviour. This paper focuses on the new design of the computer based survey instrument that dynamically generates interactive random SP designs.     The design considers all the significant travelling modes currently used in the study area including various transit access modes and also involves hypothetical travelling modes for future use. The use of the instrument in a pilot survey is discussed together with the model specification component of the study. A data collection strategy for generating the sample randomly has also been presented. The plan proposes the market segmentation to be done on the basis of stratified random sampling.    It is expected that the outcomes of the research will assist policy makers in solving the strategic public transport issues and planning the network development of the transit access modes including walkways and cycleways.
