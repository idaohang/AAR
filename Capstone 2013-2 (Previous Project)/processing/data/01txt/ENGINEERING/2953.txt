Amputees may complain of pain at the stump while wearing their prostheses.  High stresses applied onto the stump which is not particularly tolerant to loadings is a major cause of the pain.  Various experiments and finite element (FE) analyses have been performed to study the stress distribution at the socket-limb interface. In addition to the stress distribution, knowledge of the load tolerance of the stump is essential for the improvement of comfort.    There were few investigations studying the pain response to stresses applied onto the stump.  Those investigations, however, focused on one particular region of the stump or the global response of the stump to external load.  Quantitative load tolerance over different regions of the stump have not received much attention.    The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the load tolerance over different regions of the stump among trans-tibial amputees. With the help of FE analysis, the stress distribution on the soft tissue corresponding to the depth of indentation when pain is reached was investigated.
