This paper discusses a research project on on-site sewage treatment undertaken in the Brisbane area. The primary objectives of the project were to relate treatment performance to site and soil conditions. The field study consisted of sixteen sites in the Brisbane urban fringe with the subsurface effluent disposal area located on a number of different soil types. A householder survey was used to collect information relating to the sewage treatment system. This included its history, householder maintenance practices adopted and usage. The effluent quality was monitored prior to entry to the disposal field and at the exit. Detailed soil analysis was undertaken to evaluate soil physico-chemical characteristics at the study sites together with a comprehensive evaluation of site and landscape factors. The study found that site factors, physico-chemical characteristics of the disposal area and householder maintenance practices play a crucial role in effluent treatment, or renovation.
