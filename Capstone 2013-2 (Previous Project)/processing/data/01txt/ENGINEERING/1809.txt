Traditional approaches to evolvable hardware (EHW), using a direct encoding, have not scaled well with increases in problem complexity. To overcome this there have been moves towards encoding a growth process, which however have not shown a great deal of success to date. In this paper we present the design of a morphogenetic EHW model that has taken the salient features of biological processes and structures to produce an evolutionary and growth model that consistently outperforms a traditional EHW approach using a direct encoding, and scales well to larger, more complex, problems.
