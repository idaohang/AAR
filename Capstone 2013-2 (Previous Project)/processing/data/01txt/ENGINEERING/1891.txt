A geometrical channel model with hyperbolically distributed scatterers for a macrocell mobile enviroment is presented.  This model provides the statistics of Direction of Arrival (DOA) information as well as amplitude, time delay and phase data for a wireless communciations channel.  The moddel is useful for designing a forward link beamformer.  Simulation results of the channel impulse response and the probability density function for some channel parameters are presented.  The data produced from the model is consistant with real world wireless channel characteristics.
