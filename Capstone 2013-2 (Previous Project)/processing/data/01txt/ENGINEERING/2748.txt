Stagnation temperature traverses were performed in the supersonic wind tunnel behind the reflected shock wave of WMR. This had been suggested, among other obser-vations, by some earlier puzzling results from shock tube experiments. The present findings substantially confirm the hypothesis that the reflected shock undergoes a transformation which produces a departure from RH behaviour. This anomaly is found to result in a small drop of stagnation enthalpy across the reflected wave. This mechanism raises the r-waveâ€™s ailing streamline deflecting capacity. The effect goes on increasing past RR till the conditions for onset of WMR can be satisfied.
